1,1,0,Adora,.
1,1,0,Adora,"Hey, princess, you looking at me?"
1,1,0,Other,"All squadrons, report to training area immediately for evaluation."
1,1,0,Adora,Psst. Anyone seen Catra?
1,1,0,Adora,Not again.
1,1,0,Other,"At attention, cadets. Your simulation is about to begin. Here's your scenario. You'll be passing through the treacherous Whispering Woods to reach the heart of the rebel insurgency, Bright Moon."
1,1,0,Other,Your mission is to defeat the Queen of the Princesses and liberate Bright Moon in Lord Hordak's name. Where's Catra?
1,1,0,Adora,She will be here. I promise.
1,1,0,Other,"Mm-hmm. The Whispering Woods is full of princesses.  Vicious, violent instigators. They will take you out if given the chance. Don't give it to them. Good luck, recruits."
1,1,0,Adora,Watch out!
1,1,0,Kyle,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
1,1,0,Adora,"Come on, this way."
1,1,0,Kyle,"Aw, dang it!"
1,1,0,Adora,"Seriously, Kyle?"
1,1,0,Lonnie,Bra-vo.
1,1,0,Lonnie,"Seriously, Kyle?"
1,1,0,Adora,Run!
1,1,0,Lonnie,Adora!
1,1,0,Catra,"Hey, Adora. How's it hanging?"
1,1,0,Adora,"Catra. Did you really show up late and let us do all the hard parts? That is low, even for you."
1,1,0,Catra,"Aw. You know nothing's too low for me.. Now come on, you look stupid hanging down there."
1,1,0,Other,Training exercise successfully completed.
1,1,0,Catra,".  You should've seen your face. You were like, ""Aah, no! Betrayal."""
1,1,0,Adora,"Come on, Catra. We're senior cadets now. I can't believe you're still pulling such childish, immature-- Is that a mouse?!"
1,1,0,Catra,What!? Where!?
1,1,0,Adora,. Are you ever going to not fall for that?
1,1,0,Catra,I don't know. Are you ever going to let it go? That was one time.
1,1,0,Adora,"I know, but for some reason it's always funny."
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,Adora.
1,1,0,Adora,Shadow Weaver.
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,You have done well. You've completed your training course in record time.
1,1,0,Adora,"Uh, well, that wasn't just me. You know, Catra did, too."
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,"Ah, yes. How someone as unmotivated as you completed the course in that time, I'll never know."
1,1,0,Catra,"Always serving up those pep talks, huh, Shadow Weaver?"
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,"Silence. Do not be flippant with me, cadet."
1,1,0,Catra,Sorry Shadow Weaver.
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, walk with me."
1,1,0,Shadow Weaver,Adora.
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,Lord Hordak has been watching you. He thinks you are a fine candidate for Force Captain.
1,1,1,Adora,Really? Force Captain? Lord Hordak said that about me?
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,"Oh yes. He sees great promise in you. In fact, he has elected you the honor of leading a squadron in the invasion of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor."
1,1,1,Adora,Thaymor? You mean we're finally seeing active duty?
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,You are seeing active duty.
1,1,1,Adora,"But I'll be able to bring my team along, right?"
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,Your team is not ready. They'll only slow you down.
1,1,1,Adora,"Shadow Weaver, with respect, they've been training hard for this, too. And Catra, all she wants is to get out there and prove herself."
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,"Then she should have worked harder to prove herself to me. This is what I raised you for, Adora. Now is your chance to prove yourself."
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,I saw talent in you the moment I found you as an orphan child and took you in. Is this not what you've wanted since you were old enough to want anything?
1,1,1,Adora,Yes.
1,1,1,Shadow Weaver,"With you at the forefront, we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion once and for all. Do not disappoint me."
1,1,2,Angella,Send her in.
1,1,2,Glimmer,Your Majesty.
1,1,2,Angella,I'm told you disobeyed orders and led the Rebellion into a dangerous combat situation after you were ordered to retreat.
1,1,2,Glimmer,I was trying to protect a village from falling into The Horde's grasp.
1,1,2,Angella,You were reckless and put yourself and the other rebels in danger.
1,1,2,Glimmer,"Fighting is supposed to be dangerous! How are we going to hold our own against The Horde if we keep retreating? Pretty soon, we won't have anything left to defend."
1,1,2,Angella,"I'm growing tired of your back-talking, Commander Glimmer."
1,1,2,Glimmer,Why did you even make me a commander if you won't let me fight?
1,1,2,Angella,That's enough! You're grounded!
1,1,2,Glimmer,Mom!
1,1,2,Angella,You heard me!
1,1,2,Glimmer,You never let me do anything!
1,1,2,Angella,We are not having this discussion tonight. You are embarrassing me in front of my royal court.
1,1,2,Glimmer,"Oh, I'm embarrassing you?"
1,1,2,Angella,Go to your room!
1,1,2,Glimmer,I'm going!
1,1,3,Catra,"What'd she say? Hey, what's this?"
1,1,3,Adora,Hey! Give it back.
1,1,3,Catra,No way. You've been promoted?
1,1,3,Adora,"Well, kind of. I mean, yeah, I guess. Heh. But it's not a big deal."
1,1,3,Catra,"Are you kidding? That is awesome. We're gonna see the world and conquer it. Adora, I need to blow something up."
1,1,3,Adora,Umm..
1,1,3,Catra,What?
1,1,3,Adora,Shadow Weaver says you're not coming.
1,1,3,Catra,What? My time was just as good as yours today. What is her problem with me?
1,1,3,Adora,"I mean, you are kind of disrespectful."
1,1,3,Catra,Why should I respect her? She's just bitter that she doesn't have any real power that doesn't come from Hordak and everyone knows it. I guess it sure must be easy being a people pleaser like you.
1,1,3,Adora,"I am not a pe-- Catra, wait."
1,1,4,Adora,"Look, I'm sorry. I didn't even think you wanted to be a Force Captain."
1,1,4,Catra,"I don't. Here, take your stupid badge."
1,1,4,Adora,"Come on, Catra. This is what I have been working for my entire life. I was hoping you could be, I don't know, happy for me."
1,1,4,Catra,"Ugh, whatever. It's not like I even care. I just wanna get out of this dump at some point before I die of boredom. I wonder what's even outside the Fright Zone anyway."
1,1,4,Adora,Why don't we go find out?
1,1,5,Catra,I take it all back. You're officially awesome. I can't believe you actually stole a skiff.
1,1,5,Adora,Borrowed. Please don't make me regret this.
1,1,5,Catra,"I've always wanted to drive one of these things. Here, gimme."
1,1,5,Adora,"Whoa, there. Save us enough fuel to get back."
1,1,5,Catra,That's a problem for future Adora and Catra.
1,1,5,Adora,I'm driving. I want it.
1,1,5,Catra,I'm driving. I want it.
1,1,5,Catra,Can't have it!
1,1,5,Catra,Let me.
1,1,5,Adora,Give me. I'm doing it.
1,1,5,Catra,Adora. I want it.
1,1,5,Adora,"No, I've got it."
1,1,5,Adora,Catra!
1,1,6,Catra,What is it?
1,1,6,Adora,"I think this must be the Whispering Woods. They say there are strange, old monsters in there, an- and the trees move when you're not looking. Every Horde squadron they've sent in there has never come out again."
1,1,6,Catra,Let's go in.
1,1,6,Adora,"Wait, what?"
1,1,6,Catra,Woo-hoo!
1,1,6,Adora,"Catra, slow down! Catra, tree! Tree!"
1,1,6,Catra,Adora!
1,1,7,Adora,Catra? Huh?
1,1,7,Adora,Whoa.
1,1,7,Adora,Cool.
1,1,7,Other,Balance must be restored. Etheria must seek a hero.
1,1,7,Other,"Adora, Adora."
1,1,7,Catra,"Hey, Adora? Adora!"
1,1,7,Adora,Catra? What happened?
1,1,7,Catra,You fell out of the skiff after you drove it into a tree.
1,1,7,Adora,"No, you drove it into a tree."
1,1,7,Catra,"Ah, up for debate. Come on, let's go."
1,1,7,Adora,Wait. Where is it? Where'd it go?
1,1,7,Catra,What?
1,1,7,Adora,"Ther- There was a sword. It was right here. I tried to touch it, but it got really bright."
1,1,7,Catra,"Are you brain damaged? Don't be brain damaged. Oh, Shadow Weaver's gonna kill me."
1,1,7,Adora,"I'm not brain damaged. It was here, I saw it."
1,1,7,Catra,"Well, there's nothing here now. So, come on, let's go."
1,1,8,Glimmer,"""Dear Mom, I know you'll never read this, but I have to say it somewhere. I feel like you... don't respect me."
1,1,8,Glimmer,Watch it! You almost hit me!
1,1,8,Bow,"Hey, Glimmer."
1,1,8,Glimmer,"Shh! Bow, what are you doing here?"
1,1,8,Bow,What did you say? Come down here.
1,1,8,Glimmer,"I can't, I'm grounded."
1,1,8,Bow,What?
1,1,8,Glimmer,I'm grounded.
1,1,8,Bow,...What?
1,1,8,Glimmer,I'm... grounded.
1,1,8,Glimmer,I'm so mad at my mom.
1,1,8,Bow,Is this about the siege on Elberon?
1,1,8,Glimmer,"I was just trying to defend another one our villages from falling into The Horde's Clutches. She stationed me all the way out here because it's too remote to ever get attacked, but then it did, and it was my one chance to prove that I can do this. But she acts like I can't do anything because I'm just a princess."
1,1,8,Bow,"That doesn't make any sense. Everyone here is a princess. I'm, like, the only one who's not a princess."
1,1,8,Glimmer,Tell that to my mom.
1,1,8,Bow,"Hey, where does this go?"
1,1,8,Glimmer,Bottom drawer.
1,1,8,Bow,"Anyway, your mom might have a point. Only reason you got out of there is because of your teleportation powers, and, let's face it, they don't always work that well."
1,1,8,Glimmer,"Looking for support here, Bow!"
1,1,8,Bow,"I'm just saying, if you wanna prove yourself, it's gonna take more than running recklessly into any old battle. Luckily, I've got just the thing. Check this out. I detected a piece of First Ones tech in the Whispering Woods. A pretty powerful one, too, by the size of these readings. If you find this one and bring it back, your mom is bound to be impressed."
1,1,8,Glimmer,Did you forget I'm grounded?
1,1,8,Angella,Glimmer? Are you in there?
1,1,8,Glimmer,Uh...
1,1,8,Bow,Ah!
1,1,8,Angella,Glimmer?
1,1,8,Glimmer,"Everything's fine, Mom."
1,1,8,Angella,Is someone else in there? I heard voices.
1,1,8,Glimmer,No one else is in here. Can you please just leave me alone?
1,1,8,Angella,"I don't appreciate your tone right now, young lady."
1,1,8,Glimmer,What tone?
1,1,8,Angella,That attitude of yours is never gonna help you know.
1,1,8,Glimmer,"Mom, you always tell me what to do-"
1,1,8,Angella,You cannot act that way!
1,1,8,Glimmer,-And that's not fair!
1,1,8,Glimmer,I'm in.
1,1,9,Other,Adora. Adora. Adora!
1,1,9,Catra,"Hey, where are you going?"
1,1,9,Adora,Back to the woods. There's something I need to figure out.
1,1,9,Catra,What? You're not--
1,1,9,Catra,What is wrong with you? You've been acting weird since we got back. Are you sure you're not brain damaged?
1,1,9,Adora,"Look Catra, I know I saw something out there. It's ju- I just need to get another look. It feels important somehow."
1,1,9,Catra,Sounds good. Let's go.
1,1,9,Adora,No. I don't want you getting in trouble on my behalf. Just cover for me okay? I'll be back before anyone knows I'm gone.
1,1,9,Catra,Adora! Adora!
1,1,10,Bow,Come on! Come on!
1,1,10,Glimmer,Uh! Please tell me we're not lost!
1,1,10,Bow,"No, this thing is just acting up. Looks like it's being overloaded by the tech's signal. We must be getting close!"
1,1,10,Glimmer,Uhh... I think it's that way.
1,1,10,Bow,What makes you say that?
1,1,10,Bow,"Oh, yeah. That'll do it."
1,1,10,Adora,"What are you doing out here, Adora? Catra's right, this is crazy. There's no sword, you just got hit on the head a little too hard. You should just go back home and forget about all of this."
1,1,10,Glimmer,"Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?"
1,1,10,Bow,The light came from the edge of the forest.
1,1,10,Glimmer,"Yes, you saw the light. It's this way."
1,1,10,Bow,The trackpad says otherwise.
1,1,10,Glimmer,It's this way--
1,1,10,Glimmer,Horde soldier!
1,1,10,Bow,I see her!
1,1,10,Glimmer,"Bow, catch."
1,1,10,Adora,Give me the sword.
1,1,10,Adora,Get off. Stand down. I don't wanna hurt you.
1,1,10,Glimmer,Since when do Horde soldiers not want to hurt anyone?
1,1,10,Adora,What?
1,1,10,Other,"Hello, Adora."
1,1,10,Adora,Who are you? What's going on?
1,1,10,Other,"My name is Light Hope. I have been waiting a long time for you, but I could not reach you until you forged your connection with the sword."
1,1,10,Adora,You sent the sword?
1,1,10,Light Hope,"The sword is meant for you. Etheria has need of you, Adora. Will you answer its call? Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?"
1,1,10,Adora,What are you talking about? What-- What is-- What's Grayskull? You're not making any sense! I don't understand!
1,1,10,Light Hope,You will.
1,1,10,Adora,Wait!
1,1,10,Bow,Hey! She's awake.
1,1,10,Adora,What happened?
1,1,10,Glimmer,"Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions. How did you make it this far into the Whispering Woods?"
1,1,10,Adora,I just walked in. And I'm not a spy.
1,1,10,Glimmer,"Sure, sure. You just so happened to find yourself in the Whispering Woods, like you just so happened to try and steal our sword."
1,1,10,Adora,It's not yours. I found it first.
1,1,10,Glimmer,"The Whispering Woods is under the Rebellion's protection. You were lucky to make it as far as you did. Come on, Bow. Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon where she can be interrogated properly. This is perfect. Not only do we First Ones tech for the rebellion, we've also captured a Horde spy. My mom's gonna be so impressed. Now come on, on your feet."
1,1,11,Bow,"You positive we're going the right way, Glimmer?"
1,1,11,Glimmer,"I know what I'm doing, Bow. Can you please just trust me for once?"
1,1,11,Bow,"You know I always trust you, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out. I mean, I pretty much grew up in these woods and I've never even seen this part of them. I've heard stories about weird stuff out here."
1,1,11,Glimmer,"It's fine, okay? Just let me figure this out."
1,1,11,Bow,"Okay! Touchy. Sorry about her. Usually she's really nice. Not much for talking, huh?"
1,1,11,Adora,I prefer not to swap pleasantries with my captors.
1,1,11,Bow,Fair. Suit yourself.
1,1,11,Adora,"You know she's a princess, right? How can you follow her? Princesses are a dangerous threat to everyone on Etheria."
1,1,11,Bow,Is that what Hordak told you?
1,1,11,Adora,Well I thought it was just common knowledge. They're violent instigators who don't even know how to control their powers.
1,1,11,Bow,"You've never actually met a princess, have you?"
1,1,11,Adora,"Well, maybe not in person, but..."
1,1,11,Adora,What happened to this place?
1,1,11,Glimmer,Don't play dumb with me. I bet you were part of the raiding party that did this.
1,1,11,Adora,What are you talking about? The Horde didn't do this.
1,1,11,Glimmer,"Oh yeah? You're a heartless destroyer, just like all the rest of your people."
1,1,11,Adora,I'm not a destroyer. Hordak says we're doing what's best for Etheria. We're trying to make things better. More orderly.
1,1,11,Glimmer,"This is what's best for Etheria? Ever since The Horde got here, they've been poisoning our land, burning our cities, destroying everything in their path. And you're a part of it! How's that for orderly?"
1,1,11,Adora,This doesn't make any sense. The Horde would never do something like this.
1,1,11,Bow,"Did you really not know any of this? I mean, your army is called the Evil Horde."
1,1,11,Adora,Who calls us that?
1,1,11,Bow,...Everybody!
1,1,11,Adora,The Horde rescued me when I was a baby and gave me a home. They're my family. You-- you don't know them like I do.
1,1,11,Bow,Maybe you don't know them like you think you do.
1,1,11,Glimmer,There's something out there. Something big.
1,1,11,Bow,How big?
1,1,11,Bow,"So, pretty big then."
1,1,11,Bow,Watch out!
1,1,11,Adora,"Hey, bug brain! Come on, Magic Sword. Oh, where's a blinding flash of light when you need one?"
1,1,11,Light Hope,Adora. Adora. Adora.
1,1,11,Light Hope,Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?
1,1,11,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,2,0,Glimmer,"Yeah, I see her, Bow."
1,2,0,Bow,Okay. I wanted to make sure it wasn't just me.
1,2,0,Adora,Huh?
1,2,0,Glimmer,Stay where you are!
1,2,0,Adora,What did you do to me?
1,2,0,Glimmer,What do you mean what did 'I' do to you?
1,2,0,Adora,I didn't know being a princess was contagious!
1,2,0,Bow,"Okay, okay, everyone, calm down! Wanna tell us how you did that?"
1,2,0,Adora,"I didn't do anything. All I did was pick up the sword, and then, whoosh, I'm in a tiara!"
1,2,0,Glimmer,I don't care how she did it. We just have to make sure she never does it again!
1,2,0,Bow,Do it again! Do it again!
1,2,0,Glimmer,Bow!
1,2,0,Bow,Do what you did before.
1,2,0,Adora,I don't know what I did before!
1,2,0,Glimmer,No time. We have to go.
1,2,0,Adora,What is this place?
1,2,0,Bow,"No idea, but in there's gotta be better than out here."
1,2,0,Glimmer,"Everyone, grab on, I can get us in there!"
1,2,0,Bow,"Glimmer, no! You've never teleported three people before."
1,2,0,Glimmer,Do you have a better idea?
1,2,0,Adora,What's written on this door? It looks like some kind of password.
1,2,0,Bow,You can read that?
1,2,0,Adora,You can't?
1,2,0,Bow,What's it say?
1,2,0,Adora,"Uh, ""Eternia."""
1,2,0,Glimmer,"Oh, come on!"
1,2,1,Bow,"So, Horde soldier, have you always been able to read First Ones' writing?"
1,2,1,Glimmer,Wanna tell us what exactly is going on here?
1,2,1,Adora,I told you I don't know I just read the word on the door.
1,2,1,Glimmer,"Right... You read a word in a language that no one's spoken for a thousand years, and the door just opened into a mysterious ancient ruin. Sure."
1,2,1,Adora,You think I did this on purpose? You think I wanted to be a princess? Princesses are monsters.
1,2,1,Glimmer,Monsters? You're the monster!
1,2,1,Bow,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Glimmer, she did save us."
1,2,1,Glimmer,"I don't care! We can't just trust her, Bow. Or have you forgotten everything the Horde's done to us? The people we've lost. We need to find another way out of here and get her back to Bright Moon as soon as possible. My mother will know what to do with her."
1,2,1,Bow,"Hey, so, thanks for saving us from that bug thing back there when you could've escaped instead."
1,2,1,Adora,"Okay, well I didn't save you. I just wanted to get the sword, okay?"
1,2,1,Bow,Are you sure it's not because you secretly like us?
1,2,1,Adora,Wh--? I don't like you. You're my captors.
1,2,1,Bow,Sure.
1,2,2,Bow,"Thanks for saving us anyway. I'm Bow, by the way."
1,2,2,Adora,Adora.
1,2,2,Bow,"""Adora."" Ah. Weird name for a Horde soldier."
1,2,2,Adora,Is it?
1,2,2,Glimmer,For the honor of Grayskull.
1,2,2,Bow,What are we doing?
1,2,2,Glimmer,"Nothing! I mean, uhh.. Look at these carvings. I think this might be a First Ones' ruin."
1,2,2,Adora,What's a First One?
1,2,2,Glimmer,You've never heard of the First Ones?
1,2,2,Bow,"The First Ones are the original settlers of Etheria. They disappeared a thousand year ago, but they left behind a lot of old ruins and technology. Like this place."
1,2,2,Adora,"So, what happened to them?"
1,2,2,Bow,No one knows. They just disappeared. The Horde didn't tell you about them?
1,2,2,Adora,Seems like there's a lot the Horde didn't tell me.
1,2,2,Glimmer,Ugh. How do we get out of here?
1,2,2,Bow,"It'll take forever to find a way out at this rate. Hey! Wanna turn on some lights, Adora?"
1,2,2,Adora,I don't know how to do that.
1,2,2,Bow,"Maybe there's a magic word. Ooh, what's the First Ones' word for ""lights""?"
1,2,2,Adora,I don't know. I'm not magic.
1,2,2,Glimmer,"Obviously. Everyone, stand back."
1,2,2,Bow,"Uh, Glimmer? Maybe you should take it easy. We're a long way from Bright Moon. It'll be awhile until you can recharge."
1,2,2,Glimmer,Bow!
1,2,2,Adora,You have to recharge your powers?
1,2,2,Glimmer,"Can we not talk about this in front of the Horde soldier? Now, stand back."
1,2,2,Adora,Whoa.
1,2,2,Bow,Wow. Are you okay?
1,2,2,Glimmer,"I'm fine, Bow."
1,2,2,Bow,Oh hey! That's you!
1,2,2,Adora,What? That doesn't look anything like me.
1,2,2,Bow,"No, I mean, the other you. The scary one in the cape."
1,2,2,Adora,That was me?
1,2,2,Bow,"You can read that inscription, right? What's it say?"
1,2,2,Adora,"It says... ""She-Ra."""
1,2,2,Light Hope,"Greetings, administrator."
1,2,2,Adora,What is this thing?
1,2,2,Light Hope,What is your query?
1,2,2,Bow,I think it's some kind of ancient hologram.
1,2,2,Light Hope,What is your query?
1,2,2,Bow,Uh... Hi. What is this place? How do we get out of here?
1,2,2,Light Hope,What is your query?
1,2,2,Bow,Welp. She's broken.
1,2,2,Glimmer,She's old. I'm surprised any of this stuff still works at all.
1,2,2,Light Hope,Administrator not detected. Lockdown initiated.
1,2,2,Glimmer,I didn't do it!
1,2,2,Bow,No. No. No lockdown! No lockdown!
1,2,2,Bow,"Adora, you gotta get it to stop!"
1,2,2,Adora,What makes you think I can?
1,2,2,Light Hope,Query not recognized.
1,2,2,Bow,There's gotta be a password or something!
1,2,2,Adora,"Uh, stop it! Uh, Eternia! Eternia! Give me the sword!"
1,2,2,Glimmer,What? No!
1,2,2,Adora,"We need the scary lady in the cape. I don't know how, but she's the key to this place, so maybe she can get us out."
1,2,2,Glimmer,You're a Horde soldier. I'm not giving you the sword.
1,2,2,Adora,"Eternia! Uh, cape! Uh... She-Ra!"
1,2,2,Glimmer,Hold on!
1,2,2,Bow,"Glimmer, no!"
1,2,3,Bow,Glimmer!
1,2,3,Bow,Glimmer? Glimmer!
1,2,3,Glimmer,Did it work?
1,2,3,Bow,"Yeah, it worked. Barely. Are you alright?"
1,2,3,Glimmer,I'm fine. I think I used too much power getting us out of there.
1,2,3,Bow,"I don't know who could've predicted that... Oh, right. Me."
1,2,3,Glimmer,Bow...
1,2,3,Bow,Like an hour ago.
1,2,3,Glimmer,Bow!
1,2,3,Bow,"Sorry. I'm just glad you're okay. No more teleporting for awhile, okay. You could really hurt yourself."
1,2,3,Glimmer,"I'm fine, okay? Let's just get back to Bright Moon so I can recharge already. Why are you still here?"
1,2,3,Adora,What?
1,2,3,Glimmer,Bow and I are hardly a crack security team. You could've escaped at any time. Why didn't you?
1,2,3,Adora,"I just-- I wanna figure out what's happening to me, and if I go back to the Fright Zone, then I'll never know. I never knew where I came from or who my family was. Shadow Weaver said it didn't matter who I was before, that-- that I was nothing before Hordak took me in. There's always been a part of me that I don't know anything about an-- and all of this, it feels familiar somehow. I don't know how else to explain it."
1,2,3,Bow,"Glimmer's mom knows more about First Ones' tech than anyone. She'll know what's going on with you and the sword for sure. So, if you want your questions answered, stick with us?"
1,2,3,Glimmer,Let's go. There should be a village a few miles from here. They'll be able to give us a ride back to Bight Moon. We've wasted too much time already.
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,"For the last time, where is Adora?"
1,2,4,Catra,"For the last time, I don't know. You think I keep her on a leash?"
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,I know you're lying. You two are close. She would never depart without telling you.
1,2,4,Catra,"Then I guess she let us both down, huh?"
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,Have it your way. I already know where she is. We've been tracking her.
1,2,4,Catra,"Uh, then why did you ask me?"
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,Because you are going to bring her back.
1,2,4,Catra,I don't think so.
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,Your insolence will not protect her. You will do as I ask.
1,2,4,Catra,"Oh, yeah? Or what?"
1,2,4,Shadow Weaver,Or you will suffer the consequences in her place.
1,2,5,Glimmer,"Okay, the jacket comes off."
1,2,5,Adora,What? Why?
1,2,5,Glimmer,"If the villagers see a Horde soldier, they'll freak out. We gotta fix all this."
1,2,5,Adora,I feel ridiculous.
1,2,5,Bow,That's ‘cause you need something to tie it all together.
1,2,5,Adora,I don't like it.
1,2,5,Glimmer,"Point is, you don't look like a Horde soldier. Just keep a low profile. We'll be in and out."
1,2,6,Adora,What is this?
1,2,6,Bow,It's a festival. Like a big party. You don't have parties in the Fright Zone?
1,2,6,Adora,"Oh, right, parties. I mean, yeah, pfft, of course. I, uh-- I don't know what that is."
1,2,6,Bow,Ah!
1,2,6,Glimmer,"Did you even hear me? I said, in and out!"
1,2,6,Bow,"She has never been to a party before, Glimmer! This is serious."
1,2,6,Bow,"So, seriously? No parties ever?  What do you guys do on your birthday?"
1,2,6,Adora,Huh?
1,2,6,Bow,No birthdays?! How is your life this sad?
1,2,6,Adora,What is that?
1,2,6,Bow,That would be a horse.
1,2,6,Adora,It's majestic.
1,2,6,Bow,You wanna go meet it?
1,2,6,Adora,What? No!
1,2,6,Bow,"Come on, it's okay. See, he likes you."
1,2,6,Adora,This is the best day of my life.
1,2,6,Glimmer,Bow.
1,2,6,Bow,"Come on, I know you like her, too."
1,2,6,Adora,What's going on?
1,2,6,Glimmer,It's the Horde!
1,2,6,Bow,Why are they here? The people of Thaymor aren't a threat.
1,2,6,Adora,Wait. Did you say Thaymor? This can't be Thaymor.
1,2,6,Glimmer,Did you know something about this?
1,2,6,Adora,"No. I mean, yes. But there's a mistake. Thaymor's supposed to be a heavily fortified rebel fortress, not a civilian town!"
1,2,6,Glimmer,Do you really think that matters to them?
1,2,6,Adora,I can get them to stop. This is all a big mistake. I just need to talk to them. Get as many people out as you can and don't let them see you.
1,2,6,Adora,I'm sorry.
1,2,6,Glimmer,Adora!
1,2,7,Adora,Stop!
1,2,7,Catra,Adora!
1,2,7,Adora,Catra?
1,2,7,Catra,They let me drive a tank. Believe it?
1,2,7,Adora,"Catra, I don't understand. What are you doing here?"
1,2,7,Catra,"Uh, duh, we came to find you. ""Cover for me, Catra. No one will even  know I'm gone."" Seriously, did you just get immediately captured right after you snuck out--? What are you wearing?"
1,2,7,Adora,Uh...
1,2,8,Glimmer,Bow!
1,2,8,Bow,Hey!
1,2,9,Adora,There's no time. We have to put a stop this.
1,2,9,Catra,What? Why?
1,2,9,Adora,Because this is a civilian town. Look around! These aren't insurgents. They're innocent people.
1,2,9,Catra,"Yeah, sure. Innocent people who kidnapped a Horde officer. Now come on, let's get you back to the Fright Zone. Shadow Weaver is freaking out. It'd be funny if she weren't such a terrible person."
1,2,9,Adora,"Catra, no. I can't go back. Not until the Horde leaves this town alone. You have to help me."
1,2,9,Catra,What are you saying?
1,2,9,Adora,"I'm saying, this is wrong. They've been lying to us, manipulating us. Hordak, Shadow Weaver, all of them."
1,2,9,Catra,Duh! Did ya just figure that out? Manipulation is Shadow Weaver's whole thing. She's been messing with our heads since we were kids.
1,2,9,Adora,How could you possibly be okay with that?
1,2,9,Catra,"Because, it doesn't matter what they do. The two of us look out for each other. And soon we'll be calling the shots. Now, can we go home already?"
1,2,9,Adora,"I'm not going home, Catra. I can't. Not after everything I've seen. Come with me. You don't have to go back there. We can fix this."
1,2,9,Catra,"Are you kidding? You've known these people for, what, a couple of hours? And now you're just gonna throw everything away for them? Ugh. What happened to you?Adora: I don't know. But I have to do something. I'm sorry, Catra."
1,2,10,Bow,"Ah! I think that's all of them. Glimmer, let's go!"
1,2,10,Bow,What are we gonna do?
1,2,10,Glimmer,"There's nothing we can do, Bow. You're almost out of arrows and I'm almost out of magic."
1,2,10,Bow,"You can't say that. You're Glimmer. You throw yourself into every fight, no matter how hopeless."
1,2,10,Glimmer,"Ugh. Every decision I've made in the last day has almost gotten us killed. My mom's right, I'm not ready for this yet."
1,2,10,Bow,"No. You are not giving up right now. I'm sorry your mom doesn't see how strong you are, but that's her loss. You can do this, Glimmer, and you don't have to do it alone."
1,2,10,Glimmer,You're right. We need Adora.
1,2,10,Bow,We do? Didn't she just sell us out to the Horde?
1,2,10,Glimmer,I don't think she did. We need to find her. I think she can help us. Just trust me. Okay?
1,2,11,Catra,"Oh, man. That was a lot stronger than I thought. Are you okay?"
1,2,11,Adora,Catra!
1,2,11,Catra,I'm sorry! It was a reflex.
1,2,11,Adora,Why are you doing this?
1,2,11,Catra,"Because you left me. And if I don't bring you back, Shadow Weaver's gonna have my head. So, enough with your weird little identity crisis and let's go home already. Or do I need to zap you again?"
1,2,11,Adora,Glimmer?
1,2,11,Glimmer,Watch out!
1,2,11,Catra,Adora!
1,2,12,Adora,Glimmer? What are you doing? Why did you save me?
1,2,12,Glimmer,We need you. We need She-Ra. I should've given this back to you in the ruin. You could've saved us in there and I knew that. But I was stupid. And a jerk. And I almost got us killed and I'm sorry!
1,2,12,Adora,You're not any of those things. I'm the Horde soldier. How do you know you can trust me now?
1,2,12,Glimmer,I don't. But I hope I can. I feel like maybe you're here to help us.
1,2,12,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,2,13,Bow,"It's been an honor serving beside you, Horsey."
1,2,13,Glimmer,Bow! Are you okay?
1,2,13,Bow,Is that Adora?
1,2,13,Glimmer,It's She-Ra.
1,2,13,Other,Retreat!
1,2,13,Adora,Catra...
1,2,13,Bow,You did it!
1,2,13,Adora,I did?
1,2,13,Glimmer,You saved us. You saved everyone!
1,2,13,Adora,I did it. I turned against the Horde. I turned against the Horde! Why did I do that? I can't go back now. Where am I supposed to go?
1,2,13,Glimmer,"Hey, hey. It's okay. You're with us now. C'mon, let's go home."
1,2,13,Bow,Best-friends squad!
1,2,13,Bow,"Wait, whose horse was this?"
1,3,0,Bow,"Hey, we made it."
1,3,0,Adora,Whoa.
1,3,0,Glimmer,Welcome to Bright Moon.
1,3,0,Adora,It's so beautiful.
1,3,0,Glimmer,"Okay, I just need to go in there, recharge, and
deal with my mom. This'll be fun."
1,3,0,Glimmer,"Uh, Bow? Maybe we should take Adora in the back
way?"
1,3,0,Bow,"Oh, yeah. Good call."
1,3,0,Adora,What's the back way?
1,3,1,Adora,This is the back way?
1,3,1,Bow,"It might seem weird, but we totally come in this way
all the time."
1,3,1,Bow,"Oh! Hey, here. Why don't you put this robe on? No
reason."
1,3,1,Adora,You're trying to hide me.
1,3,1,Bow,What? No!
1,3,1,Angella,Glimmer! Where have you been?
1,3,1,Glimmer,"Hey, mom."
1,3,1,Angella,"All of Bright Moon has been worried sick. What were
you thinking?"
1,3,1,Glimmer,Mom!
1,3,1,Angella,"How could you
be so selfish and disobedient?"
1,3,1,Angella,Glimmer.
1,3,2,Angella,Are you all right?
1,3,2,Glimmer,"I'm fine, mom."
1,3,2,Angella,"Don't think you're not still in trouble. You didn't
even take the time to charge up before you left?"
1,3,2,Glimmer,I didn't think I'd be gone that long.
1,3,2,Angella,"Where did you go, anyway?"
1,3,2,Glimmer,"Okay. Bow and I found a piece of super powerful First
Ones tech in the woods. We knew it would really help the Rebellion, so we went
to get it and bring it back. But we got a little sidetracked. It was fine,
though, and I totally had it under control. And while we were out there, we
found something even better!"
1,3,2,Angella,What did you find?
1,3,2,Glimmer,"I can't tell you yet. But you're gonna love it. I
promise!"
1,3,2,Angella,Glimmer—
1,3,2,Glimmer,Ah! Just wait here. I'll be right back.
1,3,2,Angella,"We are not done talking about this, Glimmer.
Glimmer!"
1,3,3,Adora,"Okay, I get it. I'm guessing the people of Bright
Moon are gonna be a little less welcoming of a Horde soldier than you led me to
believe."
1,3,3,Bow,Maybe a little.
1,3,3,Adora,How little?
1,3,3,Bow,Think pitchforks and torches.
1,3,3,Bow,"It's just that the people of Bright Moon have been really
hurt by the Horde. Everyone here has lost someone in the war. You can't blame
them for being a little suspicious."
1,3,3,Adora,Sorry.
1,3,3,Bow,"Hey, it's not your fault. Once they get to know you,
the people of Bright Moon are going to trust you just like Glimmer and I
already—"
1,3,3,Glimmer,"I'm here! Okay, my mom's on her way, but no
one panic."
1,3,3,Adora,What?
1,3,3,Glimmer,I said no one panic!
1,3,3,Glimmer,"Don't worry, she'll love you. All you have to do is
use the sword to transform into She-Ra before she gets here."
1,3,3,Bow,"Wait, we're jumping straight to She-Ra with your mom?
Are you sure?"
1,3,3,Glimmer,"Yeah, I don't think my mom is going to buy, “Hey
mom, we found a Horde soldier. Can we keep her?”"
1,3,3,Glimmer,"My mom is gonna love She-Ra. We can ease her into
the Horde stuff later."
1,3,3,Adora,"Uh, Glimmer, look. I don't know if I can just ‘turn
on' She-Ra. I've only done it when someone was in danger before, and it felt a
little out-of-control last time. I'm still figuring out how all of this stuff
works."
1,3,3,Glimmer,"How hard can it be? Sword, magic words, poof! She-Ra!"
1,3,3,Glimmer,"Hey. You're gonna do great, okay? Bow and I will go
buy you some time. Just hang out here with the sword and think She-Ra thoughts.
I believe in you!"
1,3,3,Adora,"Right. Okay, sword, it's just you and me now.
So, uh…let's do this."
1,3,3,Adora,For the honor of Gray—
1,3,4,Adora,Horsey!
1,3,4,Adora,"Oh! This is much better. There's actually room to move
around here."
1,3,4,Adora,Ready to see something cool?
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,3,4,Adora,"Okay, let's try that again. For the honor of
Grayskull!"
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull.
1,3,4,Adora,For…the…honor…of…Grayskull.
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull.
1,3,4,Adora,"Honor of Grayskull,
blah blah blah."
1,3,4,Adora,"Oh, come on! Glimmer's counting on me. Don't leave me
hanging here."
1,3,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,3,4,Adora,"Horsey, no!"
1,3,4,Adora,Okay…
1,3,4,Adora,"Horsey, it's okay!"
1,3,4,Adora,"No! No, wait! Horsey! Stop!"
1,3,4,Adora,Horsey!
1,3,4,Adora,Come back!
1,3,4,Other,Horde soldier…
1,3,4,Other,Horde Soldier!
1,3,4,Adora,"Wait, you don't understand. Stop! I'm not with the
Horde. Just listen to me!"
1,3,4,Other,Go! Get her!
1,3,4,Other,Don't let her get away!
1,3,4,Other,Move!
1,3,5,Angella,"For the last time, what is this grand surprise that
I'm supposed to be so impressed with?"
1,3,5,Glimmer,"You'll see it in just a minute, Mom. I promise."
1,3,5,Glimmer,"Bow, can you go check and make sure that the
surprise is ready for us?"
1,3,5,Bow,"You got in, Princess."
1,3,5,Angella,I like that boy.
1,3,5,Glimmer,"I know you do, Mom. And you're gonna like this
surprise even more."
1,3,5,Bow,So…problem.
1,3,5,Glimmer,What?
1,3,5,Other,"Your majesty. A horde spy has been discovered on the
Bright Moon grounds. She attacked our troops with a sword and then fled with
the help of a winged beast."
1,3,5,Angella,What did you do?!
1,3,6,Lonnie,"I'm telling you. This new princess is no joke. She wiped
the floor with our whole recon squad. Twelve feet tall at least! Took out every
one of our machines with nothing but a sword."
1,3,6,Other,Did you actually see her?
1,3,6,Lonnie,"No. And it's a good thing, too. We were lucky to get
out of there alive."
1,3,6,Catra,"Oh, please. She's like every other princess: all sparkle,
no substance. She caught us off-guard. That is all."
1,3,6,Lonnie,"Sure. You were the only one who saw her up close,
and you didn't even land a hit on her."
1,3,6,Lonnie,What? Did you freeze up?
1,3,6,Catra,"You think I'm scared of some princess? I
could take her out whenever I want. I know her secret."
1,3,6,Lonnie,Oh yeah?
1,3,6,Lonnie,And what's that?
1,3,6,Catra,Hmm. Like I'd tell you.
1,3,6,Lonnie,"Easy, Catra. Adora's not here to protect you
anymore."
1,3,7,Adora,"Stupid. You just had to go out there, even
after Bow warned you about the pitchforks and torches."
1,3,7,Adora,"What do you want from me now? Haven't I done
enough for you?"
1,3,7,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull?
1,3,7,Adora,What's wrong with you?
1,3,7,Adora,Horsey? Is that you?
1,3,7,Razz,"Hm? Did you hear something? Yes, I did, too. Who's
there?!"
1,3,7,Adora,"I, uh, didn't mean to intrude. Um, but have
you seen a flying horse around here?"
1,3,7,Razz,"Oh, Mara, dearie! Is that you? About time you got
here. Come on now, there's no time to waste. 
Let's get going."
1,3,7,Adora,"Uh, you were waiting for me?"
1,3,7,Razz,[laughs[ We made plans to go berry-picking today.
1,3,7,Adora,"Look, I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me for
someone else. I don't know who you are."
1,3,7,Razz,"No, you don't know Madame Razz, do you? You're not
quite the same. This is the wrong time for my Mara, isn't it? Now you've got
the sword, instead."
1,3,7,Adora,"Wait, what?"
1,3,7,Razz,"Ah! Well, never mind. You're here now, and there's still
berries to be picked."
1,3,8,Adora,"Hey, uh, you've said something about the sword. Have
you seen it before?"
1,3,8,Razz,"Don't ask such silly questions, Mara. You
know you bring that sword around here all the time."
1,3,8,Adora,"I'm not—Okay. How long have you been living out here
in the woods alone?"
1,3,8,Razz,"Alone? Me? Oh, no! I'm not alone. I've got Broom here,
and my friend Loo-Kee, too! But he's always hiding."
1,3,8,Adora,"Oh, good, she's got imaginary
friends."
1,3,8,Adora,Whoa.
1,3,8,Razz,Ah! Here we are.
1,3,8,Adora,"I think I've seen a place like this before. This is a
First Ones ruin, isn't it?"
1,3,8,Razz,"And the best place to pick
fresh berries!"
1,3,8,Adora,"Hey, be careful up there! That thing's not safe."
1,3,8,Razz,"Oh, dearie me! That was quite a tumble, eh?"
1,3,8,Adora,Stars?
1,3,8,Razz,"Oh, we used to come here to look at the stars. Do you
remember, Mara? They're all gone now. What happened to the stars?"
1,3,8,Adora,I've seen them before. I know all of this somehow.
1,3,8,Adora,What is this? What's happening to me?
1,3,8,Adora,"Look, I know you brought me here for a reason. If you
know something about the sword, about me, you need to tell me!"
1,3,8,Razz,"I brought you here to pick berries, and your basket's
still empty. So, come on, silly."
1,3,8,Adora,Whoa!
1,3,9,Shadow Weaver,Catra!
1,3,9,Catra,What do you want?
1,3,9,Shadow Weaver,"Impertinent as always, I see. With such a
grand failure under your belt, it would benefit you to show more respect,
cadet."
1,3,9,Catra,"I did exactly what you told me to do. You are the one who didn't warn us there would
be princesses there."
1,3,9,Shadow Weaver,"I have you a simple task: bring back Adora.
Instead, your squadron is ravaged, your war machines destroyed, and Adora is
still missing."
1,3,9,Catra,"News flash, old lady: if Adora wanted to come home, she'd be here right now. Adora's gone. She defected. And I'm starting to think she had the right idea. So maybe it's you who should be showing a little more respect to me."
1,3,9,Shadow Weaver,Lies!
1,3,9,Shadow Weaver,"I am out of patience to address your incompetence
and your insubordination, cadet. You will answer to a higher power, Lord Hordak
himself."
1,3,10,Adora,Wait! Will you slow down?
1,3,10,Razz,"Eh? What's that, dearie? I don't have my glasses; you'll
have to speak up."
1,3,10,Adora,"Oh, I know you can hear me. I just—I need you to tell
me what to do!"
1,3,10,Razz,"How would Madame Razz know what you should
do?"
1,3,10,Adora,"Look, I left my whole life behind, looking for
answers about where I came from and who I'm supposed to be. The Rebellion hates
me, and I can't go back to the Horde. And I wanna do the right thing, but I don't
know what that is."
1,3,10,Razz,"Ah, it's the same old story, dearie. Wicked people
destroy what they cannot control."
1,3,10,Adora,They can't just do this!
1,3,10,Razz,"Once, the princesses would have protected us. But
these days, they—they stay in their castles, protecting only their own lands. Meanwhile,
the Horde creeps ever closer."
1,3,10,Razz,"You're very like my Mara, you know? Brave, loyal, but afraid."
1,3,10,Adora,I'm not afraid.
1,3,10,Razz,"Dearie… You ran into the woods and asked the
first old lady you could find what you should do!"
1,3,10,Razz,"No one is going to make this easy for you, dearie. Stop
waiting for someone to tell you what the right thing to do is."
1,3,10,Razz,You're a smart girl. What do you think?
1,3,10,Adora,I think…this is wrong.
1,3,10,Adora,Horsey.
1,3,10,Razz,Huh?
1,3,11,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull.
1,3,11,Other,Keep those lines taut.
1,3,11,Adora,Turn off your machines and leave this place now!
1,3,11,Other,It's the princess. Get her!
1,3,11,Other,Huh? Uh…
1,3,11,Razz,That's my girl.
1,3,11,Razz,"Take that,
you great lump! Razzle Dazzle!"
1,3,11,Adora,"Razz, no! You can't be here!"
1,3,11,Razz,Woo-hoo!
1,3,11,Razz,"Mara, dear!"
1,3,11,Other,Yeah!
1,3,11,Razz,Razzle Dazzle!
1,3,12,Razz,"Hello, dearie."
1,3,12,Adora,Ow.
1,3,12,Razz,"Swift Wind and I have been talking while you were
asleep. He thanks you for coming to his rescue."
1,3,12,Adora,Swift Wind?
1,3,12,Razz,"That's what he prefers to be called. Also, he wanted
me to make sure that you know that “Horsey” was a stupid name."
1,3,12,Razz,How do you feel?
1,3,12,Adora,I'm…I'm okay. I think I know what I need to do.
1,3,12,Adora,"If the princesses won't defend Etheria, then I will."
1,3,12,Adora,I need to get back to Bright Moon.
1,3,12,Razz,"Ah, that's the spirit, dearie!"
1,3,12,Adora,Will I see you again?
1,3,12,Razz,"If you need me, you will always know where to find me."
1,3,12,Razz,Who was that girl?
1,3,12,Adora,"Um…any chance I can get a ride back
to Bright Moon, Swift Wind? Please?"
1,3,13,Adora,Woo-hoo!
1,3,14,Angella,How could you possibly think this was acceptable?!
1,3,14,Glimmer,"Mom, you don't understand! You're not listening!"
1,3,14,Angella,"You've shown remarkably poor judgment! Allowing a
Horde soldier into Bright Moon without telling me?"
1,3,14,Bow,"Your majesty, it's not all her fault."
1,3,14,Angella,"Bow, I think it's time you went home. Glimmer and I
have a lot to discuss."
1,3,14,Glimmer,Mom!
1,3,14,Angella,It can't be.
1,3,14,Glimmer,"I was trying to tell you. Mom, meet—"
1,3,14,Angella,She-Ra.
1,3,14,Adora,"Your Majesty, I've come to pledge myself to the
Rebellion. But first, there's something you should know."
1,3,14,Other,She's a Horde Soldier.
1,3,14,Glimmer,"Mom, this is Adora."
1,3,14,Adora,"I know you have
no reason to trust me, Your Majesty. But I've seen for myself the atrocities
the Horde has committed against the people of Etheria, and I'm ready to fight
to stop them. If you give me the chance, I know I can help the Rebellion turn
the tide of the war."
1,3,14,Angella,"I know the legend of the warrior
the First Ones called She-Ra. They said she would return to us in the hour of our
greatest need to bring balance to Etheria. I never thought she was anything
more than a myth."
1,3,14,Angella,"And yet you're here now. And in the uniform of a
Horde soldier, no less."
1,3,14,Angella,"You would pledge to stand with us against those you
once served?"
1,3,14,Adora,Yes.
1,3,14,Angella,"Glimmer, you would vouch for her and take
responsibility for her?"
1,3,14,Glimmer,Yes.
1,3,14,Angella,"Then rise. The Rebellion accepts your allegiance, She-Ra,
Princess of Power."
1,3,14,Other,She-Ra! She-Ra! She-Ra!
1,3,14,Glimmer,Welcome to Bright Moon!
1,3,14,Bow,But for real this time.
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"Lord Hordak.
Kneel!"
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"I gave her charge of a simple mission: to
return Force Captain Adora to the Fright Zone. Instead, our forces suffered a humiliating
defeat."
1,3,15,Hordak,"Then you mean to tell me that you're still down a
Force Captain?"
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"Yes, my lord. But rest assured, nothing will
stop us from finding Adora and bringing her back."
1,3,15,Hordak,"No. You will elect another Force Captain and resume
normal operations."
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"But, my lord, Adora is the only viable
candidate."
1,3,15,Hordak,"You have Catra. Was she not your ward, as well?"
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"Catra has been nothing but a disappointment to
me."
1,3,15,Hordak,"If you have failed to condition her properly, you
have no one but yourself to blame."
1,3,15,Shadow Weaver,"But, my lord—"
1,3,15,Hordak,"Enough. I have made my decision. Rise, Force Captain
Catra."
1,3,15,Hordak,"Hmm.
·"
1,4,0,Glimmer,This is awesome! I can't believe Mom agreed to let you stay in Bright Moon!
1,4,0,Adora,"Yeah, awesome."
1,4,0,Glimmer,"Okay. You've seen the dining hall, the throne room, the portrait hall. So, the last stop on our grand tour is... your new room! Ta-da!"
1,4,0,Glimmer,"It's pretty standard. You've got your vanity, the bathroom, crystals, bell pull, tea nook, more crystals, bed, desk, and of course, the waterfall."
1,4,0,Adora,Is the waterfall for showering?
1,4,0,Glimmer,"Ha! Good one, Adora. ""Waterfall for showering."" I'm right down the hall if you need anything. Night."
1,4,0,Adora,Wait--
1,4,0,Adora,"Okay. This is different than the Fright Zone, but I'm sure I'll get the hang of this in no time."
1,4,0,Adora,Help.
1,4,1,Adora,"Come on, get flatter!"
1,4,1,Adora,No! Go back in! Go back in!
1,4,1,Adora,"Glimmer? Glimmer? I think I killed the bed. Ma'am! I mean, Your Majesty. Sir!"
1,4,1,Adora,"So uh, what are you doing up?"
1,4,1,Angella,"When I feel the cares of the day weighing upon me, I come here."
1,4,1,Adora,Who is that?
1,4,1,Angella,King Micah. My husband. He built the Rebellion with me. And he was one of the first casualties of The Horde.
1,4,1,Adora,Sorry. I didn't know.
1,4,1,Angella,"Adora. My daughter believes you can help us. Glimmer has vouched for you despite your background. And because I greatly love my daughter, I am willing to give you a chance. Do not disappoint her."
1,4,2,Adora,Glimmer! Are you okay?
1,4,2,Glimmer,What are you doing in here?
1,4,2,Adora,"I'm sorry! I couldn't sleep in my room. I've never slept without any other people around before. And then I ran into your mom, I think she doesn't like me."
1,4,2,Glimmer,What? My mom loves you.
1,4,2,Adora,"Yeah, sure. She loves She-Ra."
1,4,2,Glimmer,"Mom can be... a little intense, heh. But, our weekly meeting with the Rebellion Generals is today and you're invited. She wouldn't have invited you if she didn't like you."
1,4,3,Adora,Wow. Heh.
1,4,3,Glimmer,Come on. Meeting's about to start.
1,4,3,Adora,"Uh, the chairs are still empty."
1,4,3,Glimmer,"Those are for the other Etherian Princesses, but... none of them have been active members since I was a kid. The Rebellion had a big defeat years ago, and most of the old Princesses gave up. Now all the kingdoms keep to themselves, and the new Princesses do the same."
1,4,3,Bow,"Other than Spinnerella and Netossa. Hey, guys! We're not really sure what they do."
1,4,3,Adora,Ah.
1,4,3,Adora,What? What? I don't understand.
1,4,3,Angella,This is not your chair.
1,4,3,Glimmer,Sorry! First day. Won't happen again!
1,4,3,Adora,What did I do?
1,4,3,Glimmer,You sat in my dad's chair.
1,4,3,Adora,Oh... Oh. I'm sorry.
1,4,3,Angella,I've asked you here because I've received a distress call from Princess Perfuma. The Horde is laying siege to her kingdom. She's asking Bright Moon for assistance. General?
1,4,3,Other,"Perfuma's kingdom, Plumeria, is located near the front lines. The Horde has set up camp in their territory, cutting off their main supply route"
1,4,3,Angella,Bright Moon will provide food and humanitarian aid.
1,4,3,Glimmer,Ooh! I have a better idea. We can--
1,4,3,Angella,"Fight the Horde? Glimmer, you propose this idea every meeting."
1,4,3,Glimmer,"No! I was going to say, let's use aggressive fist-to-face sparkles."
1,4,3,Angella,"I said, no, Glimmer. Now sit down!"
1,4,3,Adora,"You should send me, Glimmer, and Bow to lead the relief mission. You can send me as She-Ra. I'll make sure everyone gets there safely and protect Bow and Glimmer if the Horde attacks. I promise, I won't disappoint you."
1,4,3,Angella,"Very well. You will deliver food and supplies to Plumeria, and under no circumstances will you engage the Horde. You leave at dawn."
1,4,4,Kyle,I give up! I give up!
1,4,4,Lonnie,"Quit playing around, Kyle! Where's Catra? She's supposed to be here."
1,4,4,Catra,"Not anymore, cadet Lonnie."
1,4,4,Lonnie,Why aren't you dressed?
1,4,4,Catra,"Oh, Lonnie, Lonnie... sweet, dumb, Lonnie."
1,4,4,Lonnie,They made you Force Captain?
1,4,4,Kyle,"Congrats, Catra!"
1,4,4,Catra,"Hordak knows a good thing when he sees it. Now that I'm in charge, Shadow Weaver won't be the only one...Uh..."
1,4,5,Catra,"What do ya need, Shadow Weaver? Ooh, are you giving me my first mission?"
1,4,5,Shadow Weaver,You will explain how you lost Force Captain Adora.
1,4,5,Catra,"Ugh, I've told you everything I know about Adora!"
1,4,5,Shadow Weaver,I know you're lying. You have to be lying. What happened to Adora? What did you do?
1,4,5,Catra,What did I do? She left us! She left me! You ever think Adora's not as loyal as you thought?
1,4,5,Shadow Weaver,"I will learn the truth, Catra, even if I have to drag it from your--"
1,4,5,Shadow Weaver,Out of my way!
1,4,6,Glimmer,Wow. Mom didn't say anything about all the plants dying.
1,4,6,Bow,"I don't think she knows. Wait, where's Adora?"
1,4,6,Glimmer,Are you gonna be She-Ra the entire time we're here?
1,4,6,Adora,"I told Queen Angella I would. Besides, people like me better as She-Ra. Could Adora do this?"
1,4,6,Glimmer,Hmm. Yep. Very useful to our mission.
1,4,6,Bow,"Hey, guys. What is that?"
1,4,6,Adora,Must be coming from the Horde camp.
1,4,6,Perfuma,You're here!
1,4,6,Glimmer,Princess Perfuma. I'm Commander Glimmer of--
1,4,6,Bow,"Ooh, I get a hat."
1,4,6,Perfuma,"Oh, my. Everyone, come quick! It's, Oh, it's… It's…"
1,4,6,Perfuma,Look! The universe has heard our pleas and sent the legendary She-Ra to help us save our home.
1,4,6,Adora,We heard about the blockade and we've come to help.
1,4,6,Adora,We brought food and supplies for you.
1,4,6,Perfuma,"Welcome to Plumeria, She-Ra."
1,4,6,Adora,"Um, Glimmer, what's happening?"
1,4,6,Perfuma,"Come with me, I'll show you around. You're gonna love it."
1,4,7,Perfuma,"Our people have lived here in tranquility for thousands of years. We're known for our beautiful flowers, our majestic trees. And this is the Heart-Blossom, the center of our kingdom, and the source of all my magical powers."
1,4,7,Bow,At least this tree is fine. What happened to everything else?
1,4,7,Perfuma,"We're going through a little rough patch, but I'm sure the universe will right itself soon."
1,4,7,Glimmer,Everything is dead or dying.
1,4,7,Perfuma,"Look, the blight hit right after the Horde arrived. We don't know why, and nothing I do stops it. But we don't dwell on the negative. Look at the positive. The Heart-Blossom is still healthy, and the She-Ra is here, and the celebration's about to begin."
1,4,7,Adora,Celebration?
1,4,8,Shadow Weaver,You will not refuse me!
1,4,8,Hordak,Shadow Weaver.
1,4,8,Shadow Weaver,Lord Hordak!
1,4,8,Hordak,You have disobeyed my orders.
1,4,8,Shadow Weaver,"I've done no such thing, Lord Hordak. My will is your will."
1,4,8,Hordak,Then explain to me why you've requisitioned more troops to look for one missing soldier. A soldier I ordered you to give up on.
1,4,8,Shadow Weaver,Finding Adora is crucial to the Horde's mission—
1,4,8,Hordak,"Our mission is to kill the Whispering Woods so we can march on Bright Moon. Our mission is to destroy the princesses and their ridiculous rebellion. You are distracted, Shadow Weaver. Our ground troops demand your full attention. The siege on Plumeria has carried on for too long. You will give the order to increase power until victory is achieved. And never forget, I gave you your magical power and at my slightest whim, I can take it away. Understand?"
1,4,8,Shadow Weaver,"Of course, Lord Hordak."
1,4,9,Adora,"No, no, no, it's okay. You need this food more than we do."
1,4,9,Other,Nonsense. It is our honor to serve the She-Ra.
1,4,9,Perfuma,We are so honored to have you.
1,4,9,Other,Whoa. That's She-Ra.
1,4,9,Perfuma,"Yes, I know. The She-Ra, right? I'm so happy that after all these centuries of being gone, you've finally returned. I said, break out party kale. And at our hour of greatest need, just like in the stories."
1,4,9,Adora,What stories?
1,4,9,Perfuma,"The stories we've been telling for thousands of years. She-Ra, the warrior who tamed the beasts of Beast Island with a single word."
1,4,9,Bow,That's nothing. What about the time She-Ra defeated a squad of Horde soldiers on a flying horse? Or the time she saved Thaymor from a legion of Horde soldiers? Or the time she borrowed my toothbrush and used it to defeat an army of Horde soldiers.
1,4,9,Adora,"Uh, Bow, that's not true."
1,4,9,Bow,You're right. It was two armies!
1,4,9,Adora,Uh...
1,4,9,Glimmer,"Hey, calm down! Give her some space. One at a time. You first."
1,4,9,Adora,Oh! Thank you for the…
1,4,9,Glimmer,Windchime.
1,4,9,Adora,Wind-chime.
1,4,9,Perfuma,We're so excited for you to heal our land and bring all the plants back to life. Will you be doing it before the drum circle or after?
1,4,9,Adora,You want me to--You want me to heal your land?
1,4,9,Perfuma,"Yes! Like in the ancient story, ""She-Ra Heals the Forest And Brings The Trees Back To Life."""
1,4,9,Glimmer,I've seen her do way weirder stuff. This'll be a snap.
1,4,9,Adora,"Wait, it's not that simple. Plus, I don't like the look of that smoke. The Horde's up to something big. Maybe we should investigate."
1,4,9,Perfuma,We? This is my power. I grow plants.
1,4,9,Perfuma,We're not strong enough to go up against the Horde. All we want is to live peacefully in our ancestral home.
1,4,9,Bow,And then She-Ra saved the day once again!
1,4,9,Perfuma,"We need you, She-Ra."
1,4,9,Adora,"Yes, healing. That is a thing I know how to do. I just need to take Bow and Glimmer over to those trees for a moment. I know what I'm doing!"
1,4,10,Adora,I don't know what I'm doing! I can't heal anything!
1,4,10,Bow,"But, the stories say you have healing powers."
1,4,10,Adora,They also say I fought the Mantisaur. I don't even know what that is!
1,4,10,Glimmer,Why don't you just concentrate really hard? That seems to work whenever you need to transform.
1,4,10,Adora,Okay.
1,4,10,Adora,Did I do it?
1,4,10,Bow,"No, you punched a tree. That's kinda the opposite of healing."
1,4,10,Adora,Let me try again.
1,4,10,Glimmer,Magic blast. Also not healing.
1,4,10,Adora,I'll get it this time.
1,4,10,Glimmer,Magical transformation?
1,4,10,Bow,"Wait, is that what happened to our horse?"
1,4,10,Bow,It's okay. You'll get it soon.
1,4,10,Adora,"Soon isn't good enough! These people expect me to save their land. I thought I was better as She-Ra, but I'm useless no matter what form I take."
1,4,10,Bow,My hat!
1,4,10,Perfuma,She-Ra! Come quickly! Something absolutely terrible has happened!
1,4,11,Perfuma,"The Heart-Blossom is dying. Please, She-Ra, heal our land."
1,4,11,Adora,"Oh, come on, do something."
1,4,11,Adora,No.
1,4,11,Adora,Sorry. I don't know how to heal.
1,4,11,Other,Who are you? And where's She-Ra?
1,4,11,Adora,"My name is Adora. I was chosen to carry the sword of She-Ra, but... I haven't been doing this for very long, and I don't know exactly how it works yet."
1,4,11,Other,She's just a girl!
1,4,11,Adora,"I never meant to deceive you. I am She-Ra, I'm just not the same She-Ra."
1,4,11,Perfuma,Then you can't save us?
1,4,11,Adora,"Wait! There might be another way. I know the Horde. I think they're using one of their machines to poison your land. If we wanna save your home, we have to stop them!"
1,4,11,Other,You're not She-Ra from the stories. You were supposed to save us.
1,4,11,Perfuma,"It will be all right, I promise. We will rebuild. We have to believe that the universe will repay the Horde for their evil deeds eventually."
1,4,11,Glimmer,"The universe won't protect you! You want She-Ra to fix everything, but won't even try to save yourselves? At least Adora's trying."
1,4,11,Perfuma,"If She-Ra can't save us, no one can. Right now, we just need to make sure our people are safe. We leave today."
1,4,11,Glimmer,Are you okay?
1,4,11,Adora,I just wanted to help. But all I've done is disappoint an entire kingdom. I'm sorry I let you guys down after you talked me up.
1,4,11,Bow,"We just wanted everyone to see what an awesome person you are. I thought I was being supportive, but I was actually being terrible!"
1,4,11,Glimmer,"Adora, She-Ra's not the reason we like you. We like you because you're our friend."
1,4,11,Glimmer,"You have a plan, don't you?"
1,4,11,Adora,Yeah. I think I do.
1,4,12,Adora,All clear.
1,4,12,Adora,"Okay, we need to find the machine. Every Horde camp is laid out the same. Guard duty's in half-hour shifts, so we walk in when the shift changes in three, two, one."
1,4,12,Other,Shift change!
1,4,12,Other,"Finally! I swear, boring shifts go by slower."
1,4,12,Glimmer,You were right. The Horde is poisoning the land.
1,4,12,Other,Hey! What are you doing here?
1,4,12,Adora,"What are you doing here? We have security clearance, password 5-echo-niner. Now be on your way."
1,4,12,Other,We haven't used that password in months. Hands up!
1,4,12,Bow,Adora? What do we do?
1,4,12,Adora,Run!
1,4,13,Other,"Hey, the Bright Moon guys left."
1,4,13,Perfuma,"""We've gone to the Horde camp to find the weapon killing your trees. If we don't make it, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I couldn't be the hero you wanted. -Adora."""
1,4,13,Perfuma,"She's still trying, even though we were so negative. Glimmer was right. This is our home, we can't let her do this alone! Everyone, She-Ra and our friends from Bright Moon are risking their lives to protect us from the Horde. We need to help them! Get the warchimes, we march!"
1,4,14,Adora,How many soldiers can you take?
1,4,14,Bow,Between one and... zero. Whoo.
1,4,14,Glimmer,"I'll take them all, if you give me a minute."
1,4,14,Perfuma,"I've always said the universe will repay the Horde one day. Well, I guess that day is today!"
1,4,14,Other,For the She-Ra!
1,4,14,Glimmer,Hey.
1,4,14,Glimmer,Ooh.
1,4,14,Perfuma,I've never been so alive!
1,4,14,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,4,14,Adora,For Etheria!
1,4,14,Other,Ew! Yuck!
1,4,14,Other,Retreat! Retreat!
1,4,14,Perfuma,Thank you so much! You inspired us to save ourselves. How can we ever repay you?
1,4,14,Glimmer,"Join the Rebellion, and help me reform the Princess Alliance."
1,4,14,Perfuma,"Um, are you sure? Didn't that go horribly the first time?"
1,4,14,Glimmer,It went horribly for our parents. But we have a chance to do it right. We're clearly stronger together. Think what all the Princesses united could do.
1,4,14,Perfuma,Would I get to hit more people with flowers?
1,4,14,Glimmer,Absolutely.
1,4,14,Perfuma,"You have a deal. Hey, everyone! Look at us. We're mighty rebels now."
1,4,15,Catra,Force Captain Catra reporting for--
1,4,15,Shadow Weaver,"This was brought to me by retreating soldiers, retreating because their camp was attacked by Adora and She-Ra. Pathetic, you're still trying to protect her. Did you think you could keep the truth from me?"
1,4,15,Catra,"It's just a phase, she's confused. I'll bring her back in, I swear."
1,4,15,Shadow Weaver,"Oh, yes, you will. Because until I tell you otherwise, that is your mission. And to ensure success, no matter where Adora goes, no matter how long it takes, my shadow spies will find her."
1,4,15,Shadow Weaver,Find her and bring her home.
1,4,16,Adora,What is this?
1,4,16,Glimmer,"Since you've never slept in a room by yourself before, Bow and I thought we'd throw you a sleepover, then you won't feel so alone."
1,4,16,Bow,We even got you a new bed.
1,4,16,Adora,It's wonderful.
1,4,16,Bow,"We can do this tomorrow too, since Glimmer's grounded for ignoring orders."
1,4,16,Glimmer,For one week. That's three weeks less than normal. And Mom said she'd consider my plan to recruit new Princesses into the rebellion!
1,4,16,Adora,"Thanks, guys. I might not ever be the perfect hero everybody wants me to be, but that's okay."
1,4,16,Glimmer,Of course it's okay. Do you have any idea how annoying you'd be if you were perfect?
1,4,16,Bow,Aw! Best Friend Squad is having a pillow fight!
1,4,16,Adora,"Yeah, we're not calling ourselves that."
1,4,16,Glimmer,"I prefer ""The Glimmer Group.”"
1,4,16,Bow,Nah. We're the Best Friend Squad.
1,5,0,Angella,"Council, we're looking for plans to strengthen our defenses against the Horde. Who would like to go first?"
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Me, me, me. Me. Me, me."
1,5,0,Angella,Who besides Glimmer would like to go first?
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Mom-- Uh, eugh, your majesty.  You should let me, Bow, and Adora continue our princess recruitment mission. If we can form a new Princess Alliance, The Rebellion would actually stand a chance for once."
1,5,0,Angella,The princesses withdrew from the last alliance. They chose to focus on protecting their own lands.
1,5,0,Glimmer,"So, are we supposed to just... give up? Please, let me try. All I'm proposing is a diplomatic mission."
1,5,0,Angella,"So, what do you propose?"
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Anyone approaching Bright Moon by sea needs to pass through the Salineas Sea Gate. It's controlled by Mermista now that her father's retired. With her on our side, the Rebellion could control the seas. We NEED this alliance with her, Mom."
1,5,0,Angella,"The journey is treacherous, Glimmer.  I'm not sure."
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Don't worry, Mom.  With She-Ra, we can conquer anything."
1,5,0,Adora,"And, uh, we're also gonna need a boat."
1,5,0,Glimmer,"With She-Ra and a boat, we can conquer anything."
1,5,0,Bow,Aaaaand an experienced sea captain.
1,5,0,Glimmer,"With She-Ra, a boat, and an experienced sea captain, we can conquer anything."
1,5,0,Angella,Very well.
1,5,0,Glimmer,Yes!
1,5,0,Angella,"I mean it, Glimmer. No violence, and no collateral damage."
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Thanks, Mom, you won't regret it."
1,5,0,Bow,This is so cool.  Seaworthy is just like I imagined it. Everyone here looks like a real pirate!
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Focus, Bow. We're just here to find a sea captain."
1,5,0,Bow,No pirates?
1,5,0,Glimmer,No pirates.
1,5,0,Bow,Arrrr.
1,5,0,Adora,None of these people look qualified to sail a ship.
1,5,0,Glimmer,Excuse me.
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Er, we're looking for a sea captain to take us to Salineas."
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,I won. Drinks all around. Put it on my friend here's tab.
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Uh, hiiii.  We were told you're a sea captain?"
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,I am the one and only Sea Hawk.
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,Has my reputation preceded me?
1,5,0,Bow,Your name is Sea Hawk? That's the coolest name I've ever heard!
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Captain Sea Hawk, we're interviewing potential captains to take us to Salineas. Would you like to apply for the position?"
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,Apply for the position? I am the one and only Sea Hawk. I'm offer only.
1,5,0,Adora,"Okay. Just because ""Sea"" is in your name, doesn't tell us anything about your ACTUAL qualifications."
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,"Qualifications? I once ran the 50-klick Galebreath Gauntlet in less than 20 klicks. I maneuvered the straits of Serpentine with nary a chip in the paint of my bow. My shanties are considered so desirable, that sirens fling THEMSELVES into the sea at the sound of them. And because I can tell you're wondering, my mustache is... naturally shiny."
1,5,0,Bow,It IS shiny. You're hired.
1,5,0,Bow,Ow.
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,"Whoa, there, kids. What makes you think you can afford me?"
1,5,0,Glimmer,"I assure you, Captain Sea Hawk, money is no object."
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,Behold my fee.
1,5,0,Glimmer,"Money might be an object. You know what, fine.  We'll just find ANOTHER sea captain."
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,"Good luck with that. You won't find another soul who knows the treacherous route to Salineas as well as I do. I brave it often to visit my close personal friend, Princess Mermista."
1,5,0,Glimmer,You know her?
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,Uh do I?
1,5,0,Adora,"Okay, well, here's the deal. We go one round, winner takes all. You win, we leave you alone. I win, you take us to Salineas.  At no cost."
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,"That's a terrible deal. But I am undefeated at arm wrestling. Let me show you how it's done, lassie."
1,5,0,Bow,"Go Adoraaaa, put him in the dirt."
1,5,0,Glimmer,This is so dumb.
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,Ha! Is this the best you've got? I once beat a Tyrosaur with biceps the size of my head in an arm-wrestling match that lasted two weeks.
1,5,0,Adora,Ha!
1,5,0,Bow,Yeah!
1,5,0,Sea Hawk,"Well, truth be told, I let you win so as to, ahem, boost your confidence. I've been wanting to go to Salineas anyway. Come on, kids, with me! Forward to adventure!"
1,5,2,Shadow Weaver,Adora is in Seaworthy. I'm giving you one more chance to bring her back.
1,5,2,Catra,Uh...didn't Hordak just order to you to stop going after Adora?
1,5,2,Shadow Weaver,And who is going to tell him? You?
1,5,2,Catra,Fine. About time you started treating me like a Force Captain anyway. I'll bring her back.
1,5,2,Shadow Weaver,Not so faaast. You won't be going alone. You'll be joined by Force Captain Scorpia.
1,5,2,Scorpia,"...KITTY! Just so you know, I'm a hugger."
1,5,2,Catra,Is this some kind of joke?!
1,5,2,Shadow Weaver,Scorpia will see that you are...kept in line.
1,5,2,Catra,"Ugh. Okay, whatever. You're at least giving me a vehicle, right?"
1,5,2,Shadow Weaver,Something like that.
1,5,3,Catra,No...not--
1,5,3,Scorpia,"BOATS! Oh, I just love boats, don't you? Wind in your hair, ocean on every side, miles and miles from the nearest dry land... watery death awaiting at the slightest mishap... Man... that's what I call living."
1,5,3,Catra,"Yeah, I'm really gonna need you to shut up..."
1,5,3,Scorpia,"Aw, are you seasick?"
1,5,3,Scorpia,"Now, just focus on me, okay? It'll help."
1,5,3,Catra,Put me down! What is wrong with you?
1,5,3,Catra,What are you looking at? Get back to doing boat things.
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Welcome aboard The Dragon's Daughter...III.
1,5,4,Adora,What happened to The Dragon's Daughters I and II?
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Tragically, they went down in flames..."
1,5,4,Bow,How did that happen?
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,I set them on fire. ADVENTURE!
1,5,4,Adora,Are we sure about this guy?
1,5,4,Glimmer,He just needs to get us there.
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,You'll of course be expected to earn your keep by helping out around the ship. Never fear I will teach you everything you need to know...in shanty form! Oooooh--! --What are you doing?
1,5,4,Bow,"Oh. I noticed your mainsail wasn't secured, so I fixed it."
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Tying proper knots is a task that takes years to master... You did these just now?!
1,5,4,Bow,Yes! Sea Hawk is impressed with my knots! This is the best day of my life!
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Excellent work. Even if it is just beginner's luck... We'll also need to set a lookout. Come on, Sparkle, we'll sing a shanty duet and I'll show you how to climb the ratlines... Ooooooh--!"
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Wait, how did she--"
1,5,4,Adora,I unfurled the jib.
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,By yourself? Not even a sailor as experienced as...me could do that.
1,5,4,Adora,"Oh, so what you're saying is I'm better at this than you are?"
1,5,4,Glimmer,And the name is Glimmer.
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Well, you are a strangely overqualified crew. ...What do you even need old Sea Hawk for?"
1,5,4,Glimmer,"Your map? Can we focus on our super important mission, here? More sailing, less shanty-ing."
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Of course, Shimmer! A top secret mission from the Queen! I'll get you there straight away. I'm as excited to see my dearest Mermista as I know she is to see me."
1,5,4,Glimmer,My name is Glimmer--!
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Oooooooh!
1,5,4,Glimmer,"Something's wrong... According to the map, we're way off-course."
1,5,4,Bow,"WHOO! Yeah, let's go! Go, Adora. Yeah!"
1,5,4,Adora,Ha! Yes!
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Best three out of five!
1,5,4,Glimmer,No! No more arm-wrestling. I spotted a ship graveyard in the distance and we're heading straight for it. Is anyone worried about this?!
1,5,4,Glimmer,What was that?!
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Aha! We're here.
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,The Serpent of the Sea. I knew he'd be lurking in these waters.
1,5,4,Glimmer,"Wait, you brought us here on purpose?!"
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"You see, I don't just provide sea transport. I give you a tale to tell your friends! Come on, crew. We're in for a harrowing ADVENTURE!"
1,5,4,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
1,5,4,Adora,Waaatch thiiiiis!
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,Is that a normal thing she does?
1,5,4,Bow,Yeah. It takes some getting used to.
1,5,4,Adora,"Got it! Wait, no--!"
1,5,4,Glimmer,"Let me get this straight. You steered us into a giant sea serpent just so you could, what, show off?!"
1,5,4,Sea Hawk,"That was the plan, until your tall friend there STOLE my THUNDER!"
1,5,4,Glimmer,Unbelievable. We're trying to save Etheria and all you care about is whether we're impressed with you?! I need this mission to go right or my mom will never give me another one! Just get us to Salineas. You've wasted enough of our time.
1,5,4,Adora,"Okay! Now, I got it. We're all good."
1,5,4,Glimmer,Adora--! Get in the boat!
1,5,5,Catra,Why have we stopped?
1,5,5,Kyle,"The Sea Gate is blocking our path. ...There's no way past, Force Captain Catra."
1,5,5,Catra,"What?! Oh, Shadow Weaver didn't bother to mention that there was a massive gate blocking the way to Seaworthy?"
1,5,5,Scorpia,"Wait, didn't you learn about the Salineas Sea Gate in Force Captain Orientation?"
1,5,5,Catra,There's a Force Captain Orientation?!
1,5,5,Scorpia,"Oho, yes there is!"
1,5,5,Catra,All hands on deck! We're finding a way through that gate.
1,5,5,Scorpia,"Oo, impressive Captain yell."
1,5,6,Bow,...Where is everyone?
1,5,6,Sea Hawk,"Hmm...very odd, indeed. If I know the princess Mermista--and I-I do--something's amiss."
1,5,6,Other,"Halt! Halt! Halt, I say! ...Halt... ...What's your business in Salineas?"
1,5,6,Glimmer,We've come to speak with Princess Mermista--
1,5,6,Sea Hawk,"Tell her Sea Hawk is with them, she'll be excited to see me."
1,5,7,Mermista,"Ew, who let him back in here?"
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,"Princess! Oh, it's been too long. I have dreamed of you night and day since we parted."
1,5,7,Mermista,Uh-huh... And who are you?
1,5,7,Glimmer,"My name is Glimmer of Bright Moon. We've never met, but our parents fought in the Rebellion together."
1,5,7,Mermista,"Oh, yeah... I remember hearing about the old Princess Alliance. My dad said it was a total disaster."
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,I didn't think it was possible but your beauty grows greater with each passing day--
1,5,7,Mermista,Will you quit it? I'm trying to talk to my new friend Twinkle. ...Butler can you bring us some hors-d'oeuvres?
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,"Oooo, hors-d'oeuvres!"
1,5,7,Mermista,For everyone but Sea Hawk.
1,5,7,Bow,Your guard is also your butler?
1,5,7,Mermista,I'm a little understaffed right now. Everybody fled because the Gate is falling apart or whatever...
1,5,7,Glimmer,What?!
1,5,7,Bow,What?!
1,5,7,Adora,What?!
1,5,7,Mermista,"Yeah, I know, right? It figures that I would inherit a kingdom that's crumbling, but it's totally fine--I'm...handling it. It's just kind of inconvenient because the Horde won't stop attacking us..."
1,5,7,Glimmer,Why is the gate falling apart?
1,5,7,Mermista,"I mean, who knows, but it's getting weaker everyday, and if the Horde tries to attack us again, we're pretty much dead."
1,5,7,Glimmer,"The Horde is the reason we're here. We want to rebuild the Princess Alliance. None of us stand a chance on our own, but we might be able to stop them together."
1,5,7,Mermista,"Yeah, cause that went so great the first time. Why should I help Bright Moon? It's not like they've ever done anything to help us."
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,"Mermista, if I may--"
1,5,7,Mermista,"No, no more shanties. Why did you bring him here? He is so annoying..."
1,5,7,Bow,I thought you said she liked you?
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,We have a rich and complicated past.
1,5,7,Mermista,"If by that you mean you got us kicked out of the Dolphin Social for challenging the doorman to a duel, then sure."
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,...I don't recall doing that.
1,5,7,Mermista,And that time that you set our gondola on fire in the Tunnel of Love?
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,Ooo...that I do recall.
1,5,7,Adora,...This is First One's writing.
1,5,7,Mermista,"And, who is she again? What is she doing?"
1,5,7,Bow,That's Adora. She has a magic sword.
1,5,7,Glimmer,What does it say?
1,5,7,Adora,Uh...it's something about the Gate... The First Ones must have built it. It looks like the Gate gets its power from the Salinean Runestone... It could be that the Gate is failing because it's losing its connection to the power source.
1,5,7,Glimmer,Do you think you can fix it?
1,5,7,Adora,I can try...
1,5,7,Glimmer,"Look, Mermista. You need our help, and we need yours. If Adora can repair your gate, will you consider joining us? Please?"
1,5,7,Mermista,I don't know...I guess... But he has to leave.
1,5,7,Sea Hawk,But...where am I supposed to go?
1,5,7,Bow,"...Maybe wait with the boat, okay, buddy? We'll take care of the gate."
1,5,8,Mermista,I really hope you know what you're doing.
1,5,8,Adora,"Uh...yeah, totally. I got this... For the Honor...of Grayskull!"
1,5,8,Mermista,Wow. Okay. That's...different.
1,5,8,Bow,...Is it working?
1,5,8,Adora,Don't distract me...this is a lot harder than it looks...
1,5,8,Glimmer,This might take a while. Ugh. Hang on. Where are you going?
1,5,8,Sea Hawk,I'd really appreciate it if you'd stop doing that.
1,5,8,Glimmer,Are you leaving without us?
1,5,8,Sea Hawk,"It's for the best. I'm only getting in your way... It's time for old Sea Hawk to be where he belongs: ...Alone. It wasn't always like this. Where I'm from, I had friends...a crew. Every day an adventure more daring than the last. The fact that I kept setting my boats on fire was considered charming. But here, I can't even get anyone to take me seriously."
1,5,8,Glimmer,Yeah...I know a little about that. I can't get anyone to take me seriously either.
1,5,8,Sea Hawk,You? But you're a princess....
1,5,8,Glimmer,"Try being the daughter of an immortal queen, when your powers are ""sparkles."""
1,5,8,Sea Hawk,Glitter--
1,5,8,Glimmer,Glimmer.
1,5,8,Sea Hawk,"--we just met, but I can tell you are a brave and powerful soul. Anyone who'd underestimate you would live to sorely regret it."
1,5,8,Glimmer,"Thanks, Sea Hawk. And you know what? You still have friends and a crew. Reporting for duty, Captain!"
1,5,9,Bow,Uh...Adora?
1,5,9,Bow,It's the Horde!
1,5,9,Glimmer,What?!
1,5,9,Catra,Keep us going full-speed. I've got something more important to do.
1,5,9,Bow,They're coming for the gate!
1,5,9,Adora,I just need a little more time. Keep them busy.
1,5,9,Scorpia,"Oh, come on."
1,5,9,Bow,Oh. ...You're big.
1,5,9,Scorpia,See ya!
1,5,9,Sea Hawk,Gotcha.
1,5,9,Bow,Sea Hawk!
1,5,9,Glimmer,Bow! Are you all right?
1,5,9,Bow,That was... AMAZING!
1,5,9,Sea Hawk,"Thank you for noticing, Bow. It was amazing."
1,5,9,Sea Hawk,Nothing's slowing them down. What do we do?
1,5,9,Glimmer,"I think I have a plan. But no one is allowed to tell my mom about this. Sea Hawk, I need your help. I need you to do what you do best."
1,5,9,Sea Hawk,What?
1,5,9,Glimmer,Set your ship on fire.
1,5,9,Sea Hawk,Yes!
1,5,10,Catra,"Wow. You know, the tiara actually gets stupider the more I look at it."
1,5,10,Adora,Catra... How did you find me?
1,5,10,Catra,"Did you think it would be that easy to escape the Horde? I mean, I always knew you were kinda dumb, but... come on."
1,5,10,Adora,"What's your plan, insult me until I decide to rejoin the Horde?"
1,5,10,Catra,"I don't think Shadow Weaver is planning to give you much of a choice. But, yeah, something like that."
1,5,10,Catra,"Check it out. Looks like with you gone, I got your promotion."
1,5,10,Adora,Congratulations.
1,5,10,Catra,"Seems like only yesterday this was the thing you wanted most in the world. And now you're-- ugh. Come on, Adora, hasn't this all gone on long enough?"
1,5,10,Adora,"I told you before, Catra. I'm not. Going. Back."
1,5,10,Catra,This is what you left me for? Dress-up games and a light show? And your new friends are nowhere to be seen. When did you get so weak?
1,5,10,Adora,Thanks.
1,5,10,Mermista,"Yeah, whatever, don't mention it."
1,5,10,Sea Hawk,Ha ha!
1,5,10,Sea Hawk,Adventure!
1,5,10,Glimmer,Adventure!
1,5,10,Lonnie,What the heck?!
1,5,10,Mermista,"Yay, that was cool. I'm...over it, though."
1,5,11,Mermista,"Huh, what do you know, you actually fixed it."
1,5,11,Adora,It's beautiful.
1,5,11,Mermista,I guess you're gonna be needing a new ship? I suppose you can have one of mine...
1,5,11,Sea Hawk,...She's gorgeous...
1,5,11,Mermista,Don't set it on fire.
1,5,11,Sea Hawk,"No promises. But, Princess, if I might ask for one more favor?"
1,5,11,Mermista,You're always ruining it.
1,5,11,Sea Hawk,"You should think about joining Glimmer's Princess Alliance. She is a brave and strong captain. With her at the helm, she is sure to lead the Rebellion to victory."
1,5,11,Glimmer,"Aw, Sea Hawk... You even got my name right."
1,5,11,Mermista,"Okay, I'm in."
1,5,11,Glimmer,Really?
1,5,11,Mermista,"Yeah. The Horde almost destroyed my home. I wanna help fight them. Plus, your friend over there can turn into like an eight-foot tall lady with a sword, and I want her on my side."
1,5,11,Mermista,"Wow, okay, calm down."
1,5,11,Glimmer,"You won't regret this, I promise."
1,6,0,Other,"Oh, I got it"
1,6,0,Other,Don't forget this.
1,6,0,Other,"Oh, buttered biscuits. I'll never get used to these things."
1,6,0,Other,At least I don't have to get lost in that maze of hers anymore.
1,6,0,Entrapta,A pig. So cute.
1,6,0,Entrapta,"Log. Day 103. 104? No, definitely 103.
First Ones artifact number 58 has yielded a treasure trove of intact code.
If I can successfully translate it, it could hold the secrets of the First Ones."
1,6,0,Entrapta,"Fascinating, my roots seem to be responding to the code.
This is remarkable.
Could this be my biggest step yet in making ancient and modern technology truly compatible?"
1,6,0,Entrapta,"Edit to log, I am now going to run."
1,6,0,Glimmer,Princess Entrapta will be a total catch for the Rebellion. My mother is going to be so impressed!
1,6,0,Adora,"Uh, I'm all for impressing Angella, but why is Entrapta so important?"
1,6,0,Bow,"She's a brilliant inventor. She makes robots and rehabs old tech left by the First Ones. She's a pretty big deal in the Etherian makers community.
Which I am a part of, because I dabble in gadgetry myself."
1,6,0,Adora,What does any of that mean?
1,6,0,Glimmer,"It means, if we convince Entrapta to join the Rebellion, she'll invent all sorts of cool junk for us. And then we'll finally have weapons that can stand up to the Horde's."
1,6,0,Bow,"Like my trick arrows! I'm running low so I built some new ones.
This one is a stun arrow. This one is an emergency flare. And this one, this one's just pointy.
And here is my newest one.
Sonic arrow!"
1,6,0,Glimmer,When will we ever need a sonic arrow. If we have to wake up really early?
1,6,0,Adora,Or if we get separated in a crowd?
1,6,0,Bow,"""Separated in a crowd"". I bet Entrapta will like my arrows."
1,6,0,Bow,"Must have been a rock slide. Any loud sound could cause another slide.
We need to be as quiet as -"
1,6,0,Adora,FOR THE HONOR OF GRAYSKULL!
1,6,0,Adora,Ha! I'm getting the hang of this.
1,6,0,Bow,That was incredibly dangerous.
1,6,0,Adora,What's the big deal? It worked.
1,6,0,Bow,You can't just bust through everything with magic. She-Ra could have caused an avalanche.
1,6,0,Adora,"But she didn't, OK? I've spent my whole life without powers. No way I'm going to stop using them now."
1,6,0,Bow,"Whoa, she's got lightning."
1,6,0,Glimmer,Something's wrong. The castle's distress beacon is lit. They must be under attack.
1,6,0,Adora,There's been no reports of the Horde in this area.
1,6,0,Bow,"No, be careful!"
1,6,1,Glimmer,You okay?
1,6,1,Adora,This place feels wrong... It's nothing.
1,6,2,Adora,"Hey, who's there?"
1,6,2,Glimmer,"Hello? Princess Entrapta. We're here to, uh, recruit you for the Rebellion."
1,6,2,Bow,"Okay, we need to be careful. Entrapta has traps set up all over her castle. They're supposed to be really cool."
1,6,2,Other,They're coming. Get out of the square.
1,6,2,Adora,Who's coming? Is it the Horde?
1,6,2,Glimmer,Hello? Come back.
1,6,2,Glimmer,I'm thinking we should probably move away from whatever is making that sound.
1,6,2,Adora,This way.
1,6,2,Adora,What the-
1,6,2,Bow,Looks like one of Entrapta's designs. Why would it attack us?
1,6,2,Adora,"Alright, stand back."
1,6,2,Bow,"Careful, it could be a-"
1,6,2,Bow,Glimmer! Adora!
1,6,2,Glimmer,Bow! He's all alone with those things! He needs us!
1,6,2,Adora,We have to get out of here first.
1,6,2,Glimmer,"Come on, I'll teleport us out."
1,6,2,Adora,"Uh, is this out?"
1,6,2,Glimmer,Ugh.
1,6,2,Adora,"Okay, no more teleporting from now on."
1,6,2,Glimmer,Sounds like a good idea.
1,6,2,Glimmer,Not again.
1,6,2,Entrapta,Princesses! I'm saved!
1,6,2,Glimmer,"Princess Entrapta? I mean, so good to see you. I hope you don't mind, but we sort of let ourselves in."
1,6,2,Adora,"And then we let ourselves out of your cage, trap thing."
1,6,2,Entrapta,"Welcome to Dryl!
Things are usually really fun around here, but right now it's all kind of teensy bit deadly."
1,6,3,Bow,Let me go.
1,6,3,Other,"Please keep your voice down sir.
The robots respond to sound."
1,6,3,Other,We're just trying to help you.
1,6,3,Bow,"Oh, thanks? What's going on? Why are the robots attacking people?"
1,6,3,Other,We don't know. We're just the kitchen staff.
1,6,3,Other,Miniature cupcake? Princess Entrapta only eats tiny food.
1,6,3,Other,And delicious fizzy beverages.
1,6,3,Bow,"Uh, thank you?"
1,6,3,Other,"You'll be safe in here with us. We've got enough food to last for months. It's tiny, but still."
1,6,3,Other,"The bots will run out of power eventually, right?"
1,6,3,Bow,We need to do something. You can't just hide in here forever.
1,6,3,Other,Oh yes we can. We don't have powers like the princesses. We can't - fight.
1,6,3,Other,"Sir, kindly quiet your whatever that is."
1,6,3,Bow,"It's a tracker pad. It tracks energy signatures from magic.
It will help me find my friends."
1,6,3,Other,Are those little dot thingies your friends?
1,6,3,Bow,Gonna go with no.
1,6,4,Entrapta,You're lucky I found you. I designed the castle as a labyrinth. I'm the only one who can navigate it.
1,6,4,Glimmer,Which means you can help us find our friend?
1,6,4,Entrapta,Absolutely.
1,6,4,Adora,Is she sure about that?
1,6,4,Glimmer,"Hi, um, I think we passed this picture already."
1,6,4,Entrapta,"Oh, isn't it cute?
You might be right. I usually have my electronic map to get around. But, well, like my bots it's sort of evil right now."
1,6,4,Glimmer,"Yeah, about that-"
1,6,4,Adora,Why did you invent killer robots?
1,6,4,Entrapta,"You're abnormally tall. Hello! I like your sword. It's First Ones tech, right? Can I touch it?"
1,6,4,Adora,"Uh, thank you, yes, and no, not right now."
1,6,4,Glimmer,About the killer robots?
1,6,4,Entrapta,"They didn't start out that way. Usually they're super useful. They do almost everything for me. Cleaning, filing, basic hygiene. Oh, and they're sound activated. Here, I'll show you!"
1,6,4,Glimmer,"Uh, can we maybe not do that?"
1,6,4,Entrapta,Isn't it adorable?
1,6,4,Entrapta,It's trying to talk!
1,6,4,Glimmer,"Whatever it's saying, I don't think it's good."
1,6,4,Adora,Make it stop.
1,6,4,Glimmer,Make what stop?
1,6,4,Entrapta,Bot 329 is attempting to communicate.
1,6,4,Entrapta,"Oh no, bad bot."
1,6,4,Adora,Princess!
1,6,4,Glimmer,She-Ra! Stop!
1,6,5,Other,"Oh, the door won't hold much longer."
1,6,5,Bow,Almost done.
1,6,5,Other,Are you sure about this?
1,6,5,Other,"Uh, you guys..."
1,6,5,Bow,Now!
1,6,5,Other,Here goes nothing.
1,6,5,Other,Shoot it already.
1,6,5,Bow,"I can't, it's a sonic arrow, it'll draw more bots."
1,6,5,Other,"Is it over? I did that? Hey, I did that!"
1,6,5,Bow,"Nice work, now let's find my friends! Come on."
1,6,6,Entrapta,"The tall one seems infected too. She turned less tall.
How does it work?"
1,6,6,Glimmer,"She's not an it, she's my friend.
And what do you mean she's infected too?"
1,6,6,Entrapta,"It's really fascinating.
I've been experimenting with a disc that was recovered from a mine in Dryl.
It was a game-changer.
It held more complete First One's code than anything I've ever seen before.
But it seems to have reacted with the First Ones tech that powers my bots.
It infected them with some sort of a virus."
1,6,6,Glimmer,But why would it make She-Ra sick?
1,6,6,Glimmer,"First, you're not taking her apart. She is a PERSON!   Second, if we destroy this disc, will that turn off the bots and stop the virus?"
1,6,6,Entrapta,Destroy it? But the experiment isn't complete!
1,6,6,Glimmer,I think we can safely say that this experiment is a failure!
1,6,6,Entrapta,"But what if it's not- no, you're right, it's a failure."
1,6,6,Glimmer,How are you feeling?
1,6,6,Adora,Just peachy. Why are we whispering?
1,6,6,Glimmer,Sound activates the robots.
1,6,6,Adora,What ROBOTS?
1,6,6,Glimmer,The ones that are attacking us.
1,6,6,Adora,"Oh, those robots. Okay, I'm going to take a nap now."
1,6,6,Glimmer,"No no no no, stay awake, we have to go to Entrapta's lab and destroy this disc thing and then you'll be all better again."
1,6,6,Adora,"Better? I'm fine. I'm She-Ra. Hi, Glimmer."
1,6,6,Glimmer,"Come on, we've got to get to your lab. She's getting worse."
1,6,6,Entrapta,A-ha!
1,6,7,Entrapta,"Oh, we're here. I mean, uh, of course we're here. We were never lost."
1,6,7,Entrapta,"Wow, the door is infected too, it won't let us in. That is so smart. And awful. We're all going to die."
1,6,7,Glimmer,"It's okay, I've got this one. I'll just teleport into the lab."
1,6,7,Entrapta,"Ooo, teleportation. How does that work? Tell me everything."
1,6,7,Glimmer,"Sure, but maybe later, when we're not, like, facing a robot uprising."
1,6,7,Entrapta,It's a date.
1,6,7,Glimmer,I'll be right back.
1,6,7,Adora,"Okay, I'm just gonna wait here."
1,6,7,Glimmer,That was not such a great plan. The lab is very full of robots.
1,6,7,Entrapta,How did they look?
1,6,7,Glimmer,Pretty evil. I couldn't get anywhere near the disc.
1,6,8,Bow,"Aw, he's kind of cute.
Uh, guys, a little help?"
1,6,8,Other,Please don't say it's more bots.
1,6,8,Bow,"No, that's Glimmer teleporting. I know where Glimmer and Adora are. Uh oh, that's not good. We have to do something, we have to save them."
1,6,8,Other,"Oh no, sir, no thank you."
1,6,8,Other,"It's one thing to fight them off out of necessity, but to seek out danger? It's madness. Pardon me."
1,6,8,Other,"Look, they're princesses, they have powers. I make baked goods."
1,6,8,Bow,"Sure, we don't have powers like the princess, but that never stopped me, and it doesn't have to stop you."
1,6,8,Other,"But you're a master archer, we're just ordinary people."
1,6,8,Bow,"I'm a master archer who's out of arrows, but that never stopped me either.
You each have a skill that only you can do, even if it doesn't come from some magical jewel. You say you're just ordinary people, I say you're warriors of the Rebellion!"
1,6,8,Other,To the Rebellion!
1,6,9,Glimmer,"Right now, I think that's a bad thing. We need to find another way into the lab."
1,6,9,Entrapta,"The air duct, we can use that."
1,6,9,Entrapta,I don't suppose you have any other magical powers that could be useful right now?
1,6,9,Glimmer,I don't have enough energy to teleport us all. Not without leaving someone's legs behind.
1,6,9,Entrapta,I'll give up one of mine if you give up one of yours.
1,6,9,Glimmer,It's Bow!
1,6,9,Adora,"Yay, there's a rainbow!"
1,6,9,Bow,Nice!
1,6,9,Glimmer,Bow! You're okay! I was so worried.
1,6,9,Bow,"Big fan of your work, Princess Entrapta. Uh, maybe not this work, exactly,
but your other work."
1,6,9,Entrapta,Hi.
1,6,9,Adora,Hi
1,6,9,Bow,"You okay, Adora?"
1,6,9,Adora,"Oh, yeah, sure, I'm totally -"
1,6,9,Glimmer,"Entrapta was experimenting with First One's tech, and it infected all of her machines with some kind of virus, and She-Ra's sword got infected to and made Adora all, oh, weird.
I teleported into the lab and it's full of bots and maybe with She-Ra we'd have a chance, but without her, it's hopeless."
1,6,9,Bow,We don't need She-Ra. We can do this together.
1,6,9,Bow,"Okay, where's the disc?"
1,6,9,Entrapta,How fascinating. It has completely protected itself.
1,6,9,Bow,We have to find a way to turn it off.
1,6,9,Adora,"Hey, guys, I've found the bots."
1,6,9,Glimmer,Adora!
1,6,9,Bow,Glimmer!
1,6,9,Other,We'll get your friends. You two get that disc turned off.
1,6,9,Bow,Keep 'em busy.
1,6,9,Other,"We got your back, princesses."
1,6,9,Entrapta,Ha! The power conduit!
1,6,9,Bow,"Uh, why isn't the computer turning off?"
1,6,9,Entrapta,It's running on its own power now! That's it. We need to get outta here and burn this place to the ground. Experiment officially failed.
1,6,9,Bow,"Wait, I have an idea."
1,6,9,Bow,"Now's your chance, sonic arrow! I believe in you!"
1,6,9,Entrapta,"Thanks, former tall one, and companions, for saving our lives. I would be honoured to join your Rebellion and provide you with weapons."
1,6,9,Bow,"Thanks, guys. You saved us all back there. The Rebellion needs regular people now more than ever."
1,6,9,Other,We are ready.
1,6,10,Glimmer,"So, maybe you had a point before."
1,6,10,Bow,"What? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you."
1,6,10,Adora,"I think what Glimmer is trying to say is that you were right, we can't always rely on our powers."
1,6,10,Bow,"Ooohhh, is that what you were trying to say Glimmer? That I was right?"
1,6,10,Glimmer,Yes.
1,6,10,Bow,And my sonic arrow was a great idea?
1,6,10,Glimmer,"Yes, it was brilliant, and you were totally right, okay?"
1,6,10,Adora,"If you hadn't come, the bots would have gotten us for sure. And, I didn't know that She-Ra could get sick like that. What if it happens again?"
1,6,10,Bow,"It won't. We destroyed that evil, She-Ra hating disc."
1,6,10,Adora,"Good, I never want to feel that way again."
1,6,10,Glimmer,"Thanks for saving us, Bow."
1,6,10,Bow,All in a day's work for Bow and his band of Kitchen Knights! His Baking Brigade! Pastry Patrol! I'm still working that out.
1,6,10,Glimmer,"Oh, look at that rock just staring at us. 
Boy, that rock really needs smashing. And since She-Ra's not sick anymore, she should probably smash it!"
1,6,10,Adora,A-ha! What? it's practise. For the honor of Grayskull!
1,6,10,Entrapta,"Log. Day 105. 104? Eh.
The last experiment hit a few bumps, but it was not a total failure. I made some important discoveries. The disc is way more powerful than I ever imagined.
With a few adjustments, I'm sure the next experiment will be a success."
1,7,0,Other,Adora
1,7,0,Bow,Good morning Glimmer.
1,7,0,Glimmer,Noooo. It's too early. Five more minutes.
1,7,0,Bow,But it's a beautiful morning.
1,7,0,Glimmer,Today's cancelled. Go back to bed.
1,7,0,Glimmer,I can feel you staring at me. Why is it the one who snores is always the first one to fall asleep?
1,7,0,Bow,"What? I don't snore. Adora, do I snore? Adora?"
1,7,0,Glimmer,"Sorry, too early to teleport."
1,7,0,Bow,What are we looking at?
1,7,0,Adora,I don't know. I heard a noise in the woods last night. And I thought I saw something.
1,7,0,Glimmer,What? Like a bunny? Maybe a butterfly?
1,7,0,Glimmer,"Adora, did you get any sleep at all?"
1,7,0,Adora,Someone has to stand guard.
1,7,0,Glimmer,"Okay, I know you're on edge because of what happened with Entrapta's infected robots, but it's all over now. You've got to relax. You need a vacation. Which is why we're going to Mystacor."
1,7,0,Bow,Mystacor? No way.
1,7,0,Adora,"Wait, what's Mystacor?"
1,7,0,Glimmer,"It's a secret floating kingdom that's home to all of Etheria's sorcerers. It's got tranquil gardens, and beautiful beaches and healing springs. And my aunt Castaspella just happens to be the head sorceress there."
1,7,0,Bow,"You'll love it Adora. Plus you won't have to worry about evil things in the woods. Mystacor is protected by an invisibility spell, so evil can't find it."
1,7,0,Glimmer,It's the safest and most peaceful place in all of Etheria. We'll have you relaxing in no time.
1,7,0,Adora,"You know I've never relaxed in my life, right?"
1,7,0,Bow,"Well, we're here to change that. Just wait."
1,7,1,Catra,"Shadow Weaver, you wanted to see me?"
1,7,1,Shadow Weaver,Ah. Force Captain. How kind of you to join me.
1,7,1,Catra,What's up with you? You're being spookier than usual.
1,7,1,Shadow Weaver,My shadow spies have found Adora. She's on her way to Mystacor with her new friends. Mystacor. This is going to be too easy.
1,7,1,Catra,Another Adora mission. Fine. When do I leave?
1,7,1,Shadow Weaver,"The only place you're headed is outside my door to stand guard. I'm going to use my magic to go after Adora myself. You will see that I am not disturbed. Clearly, no one else can be trusted to bring her back to the Horde, least of all you. Now go."
1,7,1,Shadow Weaver,"I said, go!"
1,7,1,Shadow Weaver,"From the farthest reaches of Etheria, I command you, be as one!"
1,7,2,Glimmer,We're here!
1,7,2,Adora,"We're on a cliff, overlooking a thousand foot drop."
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Yes we are, but not for long."
1,7,2,Bow,Woo-hoo!
1,7,2,Glimmer,Woo-hoo!
1,7,2,Adora,"Uh, guys?"
1,7,2,Bow,"C'mon Adora, jump!"
1,7,2,Bow,"Oh, ouch. You okay?"
1,7,2,Adora,I'm fine. I thought I saw-- I'm just stressed.
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Hang in there Adora. Next stop, Mystacor."
1,7,2,Bow,We rode a flying mountain through clouds. It never gets old.
1,7,2,Adora,"Uh, sure, yea, heh. It was great."
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Just so you know, my aunt Casta can be a lot. But don't worry, I know how to handle her."
1,7,2,Castaspella,Is that my Glimmer?
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Hi, Aunt Casta."
1,7,2,Castaspella,It's been so long since you've come to visit. And Bow.
1,7,2,Castaspella,And who's this?
1,7,2,Glimmer,"This is my friend Adora. She's sometimes an 8 foot tall warrior woman named She-Ra. So, don't get freaked out when it happens."
1,7,2,Adora,Hi.
1,7,2,Castaspella,"Adora. How nice Glimmer has started making some new friends. We were all so pleased when she started bringing Bow around. I was sure she had made him up at first. Oh, you've done something to your hair."
1,7,2,Glimmer,"What? Yes, I cut it."
1,7,2,Castaspella,I can see that. I also see you're not wearing the sweater I knitted for you. Don't you like it?
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Sure, I like it. It's great. It's just... it's a little warm for sweaters right now."
1,7,2,Castaspella,But you'd tell me if you didn't like it?
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Yes, I'd tell you."
1,7,2,Bow,I'm wearing the socks you sent me.
1,7,2,Castaspella,"Well, I've always been fond of this one. So, what brings you all the way out here to visit your aunt? Is it once in a blue moon already?"
1,7,2,Glimmer,"We're on a diplomatic mission, Auntie. I'm rebuilding the Princess Alliance and..."
1,7,2,Castaspella,"My goodness, you must be starving. I'll have a feast prepared. I'm sure your mother hasn't been feeding you."
1,7,2,Adora,Wow.
1,7,2,Castaspella,"You've come at the perfect time, there's an eclipse this evening. I'm headed right now to inspect the Lunarium for the ceremony. And nothing would make me happier than to give my favorite niece and her friends a tour."
1,7,2,Glimmer,"Uh, Bow and I have had the tour before. And we don't want to get in your way."
1,7,2,Bow,It's all right Glimmer. Adora hasn't seen it. It'll be fun.
1,7,2,Castaspella,"Oh, well, I guess it's up to Adora then. What do you say my dear?"
1,7,2,Adora,Uh...sure?
1,7,2,Castaspella,"Oh, I like her."
1,7,3,Adora,Wow.
1,7,3,Castaspella,"The lunar lenses. We use them in the monthly ceremonies to renew Mystacor's magic defenses and keep us shielded from the outside world. You will be coming to the Eclipse Ceremony tonight, won't you?"
1,7,3,Glimmer,"Aunt Casta, I've seen the ceremony dozens of times. And we're all really tired from traveling. Maybe we'll skip it this time?"
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Nonsense. Your friend Adora hasn't seen it, and it's quite a sight to behold for a newcomer. Besides, don't you want to spend more time with your aunt?"
1,7,3,Glimmer,Of course. But we also really wanted to show Adora the beach.
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Well, if the beach is the only reason you're here, I really shouldn't keep you, should I? I certainly don't want to waste your time."
1,7,3,Glimmer,"Auntie, I didn't mean it that way."
1,7,3,Bow,Adora?
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Well, someone is enthusiastic."
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Ah, yes. The hall of sorcerers. These are the Great Ones that led Mystacor through the ages. This is my Micah, my brother. We trained in these very walls together. Glimmer looks just like him you know."
1,7,3,Glimmer,He had a beard.
1,7,3,Adora,"Wait, Glimmer's dad was your brother?"
1,7,3,Bow,"Adora, do you know what aunt means?"
1,7,3,Adora,No. I was just hoping somebody would eventually explain.
1,7,3,Glimmer,"Auntie, we're going to avenge my dad and make sure the Horde never hurts anyone else. Mom believes in us, and in She-Ra."
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Well, if your mother believes, who am I not to? She's an angelic being after all, and I'm just a common sorceress."
1,7,3,Glimmer,"Ugh. Please, not this again."
1,7,3,Castaspella,"She never writes to me you know. I send letters, but do I ever get a reply?"
1,7,3,Adora,What happened to her?
1,7,3,Castaspella,"Light Spinner. A scar on Mystacor's past. She sought power and control above all else, and she was cast out. Although, some say she never really left. That she's only biding her time, waiting to exact her revenge. But those are only children's tales, of course. Anyway, on with the tour. Are you hungry? I've had the dinning room redone since the last time you were here, Glimmer."
1,7,3,Glimmer,Okay. Aunt Casta's gone to fix us a big dinner and now it's finally beach time!
1,7,3,Bow,You okay?
1,7,3,Glimmer,"It's worse than we thought. You need warm sand and calming waves, stat."
1,7,4,Shadow Weaver,It's time for something more.
1,7,6,Adora,"So, we just, like, lie here?"
1,7,6,Glimmer,Absolutely. Letting your cares melt away. Didn't you do something like this to relax in the Horde?
1,7,6,Adora,"Uh, no. We hit things."
1,7,6,Glimmer,"Well, this is so much better. Right Bow?"
1,7,6,Glimmer,"Just try it, okay?"
1,7,6,Adora,Okay.
1,7,6,Adora,Boop.
1,7,6,Adora,Okay.
1,7,6,Glimmer,"This isn't working for you, is it?"
1,7,6,Adora,No. Can I move now?
1,7,6,Glimmer,Yes.
1,7,6,Glimmer,"Clearly we're going to have to take this relaxation thing to the next level. Bow, wake up."
1,7,6,Bow,What?
1,7,6,Glimmer,Come on. We need to show Adora the steam grotto.
1,7,6,Bow,Whoo! Steam grotto.
1,7,7,Adora,Wow.
1,7,7,Bow,Right?
1,7,7,Bow,Ah. Ooh. Ah.
1,7,7,Glimmer,"These pools are full of magical healing minerals. The sorcerers use them to cleanse themselves of worry and fear before big ceremonies or spells. Now, just clear your mind. Breathe deeply. Focus on the warmth on your skin. Let your body go perfectly..."
1,7,7,Adora,Ah.
1,7,7,Other,Adora.
1,7,7,Adora,"No, no, no, no, no! Help!"
1,7,7,Glimmer,Adora!
1,7,7,Adora,Shadow Weaver's here. I saw her!
1,7,7,Bow,"Adora, there's no one else here. You brought your sword in here? Are you ok? What happened?"
1,7,7,Adora,Shadow Weaver was here. In the grotto. And she was in in the sorcerers hall too. I saw her shadow on the floor.
1,7,7,Glimmer,What are you talking about? Who is Shadow Weaver?
1,7,7,Adora,Shadow Weaver raised me in the Horde. She taught me how to read and tie my boots and how to subvert the enemy and be victorious in battle.
1,7,7,Glimmer,"OK. Sure, mom stuff."
1,7,7,Adora,"No, commanding officer stuff...and mom stuff."
1,7,7,Glimmer,"Adora, she isn't here. She was never here. It's not possible."
1,7,7,Adora,But you don't know what she's capable of.
1,7,7,Bow,"Sounds like this Shadow Weaver really did a number on you growing up. But you're okay now. You got away from her. Do you wanna try something else? We could get massages, or find you something to hit, if that would work better."
1,7,7,Adora,No. It's okay. I'm okay. I think I need to be alone. Clear my head.
1,7,7,Glimmer,You sure?
1,7,7,Adora,Yea.
1,7,7,Glimmer,Adora has finally lost it. Did you see her in there? I think she's going nuts.
1,7,7,Adora,"I'm not crazy. I'm, I'm not crazy."
1,7,8,Adora,"You're just a stupid statue. Pull it together Adora, there's no way Shadow Weaver can be here."
1,7,8,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,7,8,Other,"Hey, Adora."
1,7,8,Adora,"Catra, where are you? How did you find me here?"
1,7,8,Other,Nope. Getting colder.
1,7,8,Adora,"Whatever you're doing, I won't let you get away with it. Did Shadow Weaver send you?"
1,7,8,Other,What do you think? Shadow Weaver controls us both. She always has.
1,7,8,Adora,"Catra, wait."
1,7,8,Adora,Catra?
1,7,8,Other,"The Horde had high hopes for you, Force Captain. Disappointing. Does the Rebellion truly think you can save them? Nothing can stop the Horde, least of all you."
1,7,8,Adora,Show yourself.
1,7,8,Other,"You will lead them all, every Etherian, to their complete and utter annihilation. Nothing will be left of Bright Moon but smoking ruins. Your new friends buried beneath."
1,7,8,Castaspella,What have you done?
1,7,8,Adora,"Uh,sorry. I didn't mean... I thought I just saw..."
1,7,8,Glimmer,Adora!
1,7,8,Castaspella,Your friend has destroyed a thousand years worth of sacred writings. She could have destroyed the lenses that protect Mystacor.
1,7,8,Bow,She didn't mean to. Adora would never...
1,7,8,Castaspella,This is the kind of person you hang around with?
1,7,8,Glimmer,"Auntie, wait."
1,7,8,Adora,Glimmer.
1,7,8,Glimmer,"It's okay, I'll handle her."
1,7,8,Bow,"The Horde isn't here, Adora. You need to sleep. Promise me you'll try."
1,7,8,Adora,"Okay, I'll try."
1,7,9,Adora,"Glimmer. Look, I'm really sorry about--"
1,7,9,Glimmer,"Save it, Adora. How could you do this? I thought you were supposed to be our friend."
1,7,9,Adora,I am your friend.
1,7,9,Glimmer,You've ruined everything I've worked for. What kind of a friend does that?
1,7,9,Adora,Glimmer.
1,7,9,Glimmer,You know what? Maybe you should just go.
1,7,10,Glimmer,Is Adora coming?
1,7,10,Bow,I didn't want to wake her up. She needs to sleep.
1,7,11,Bow,"Adora, come on, we have to get out of here now."
1,7,11,Adora,What's happening?
1,7,11,Bow,The protection spell is failing. We need to go!
1,7,11,Adora,"Wait, stop. What do you mean failing? Where's Glimmer?"
1,7,11,Bow,"Everything that's about to happen is your fault, Adora. You're to blame."
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,Adora.
1,7,12,Adora,Shadow Weaver!
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,"The eclipse is nearly over Adora. When it is, the shield will be down. The Horde will conquer Mystacor and bring you home to me."
1,7,12,Adora,"No, I'll stop you."
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,Why? To help these people? Who are they to you? They don't understand you. Just as they did not understand me when I walked among them as Light Spinner.
1,7,12,Adora,What?
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,They feared my dark power. They'll never accept you. Not like I do.
1,7,12,Adora,"No, no! You're wrong. For the honor of Grayskull!"
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,"You know deep down what I say is true. You are the ambitious, cutthroat, ruthless warrior I raised you to be."
1,7,12,Adora,No.
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,The Princesses don't care about you. They want to use you for your strength. Return now to the Fright Zone. Rule by my side.
1,7,12,Adora,These are my friends. They've been kind to me. Something you never were.
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,I prepared you for greatness!
1,7,12,Adora,"But you never loved me. You just played twisted mind games. I'm none of the things you say I am. I'm not like you. You are bitter and cruel, and you're the one who used me! This is who I am. You hurt my friends, so now you're gonna pay!"
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,It's too late. The eclipse will be over in moments. Mystacor will fall and it will be your fault.
1,7,12,Adora,Huh?
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,"I can give you Etheria. We can rule together. You were nothing before I took you in, Adora. And you will be nothing without me! You're weak!"
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, enough of this. Come home."
1,7,12,Adora,I'm not going back. You have no power over me anymore.
1,7,12,Shadow Weaver,No!
1,7,12,Glimmer,"Adora, are you okay?"
1,7,12,Adora,"I'm okay. Yeah, I think I'm finally okay. She's gone."
1,7,12,Bow,I'm so sorry we didn't believe you! We've been bad friends.
1,7,12,Adora,"No! You're not. This is what Shadow Weaver does. She manipulates people, she pushes them apart. But it's never going to work on me again. I'm sorry, it's my fault she was here. I endangered Mystacor."
1,7,12,Castaspella,"Nonsense, you saved Mystacor. Glimmer has chosen her friends well. I'll knit you a sweater. What size are you in the shoulders?"
1,7,12,Adora,"I'm like, really tired."
1,7,13,Adora,Glimmer?
1,7,13,Glimmer,"Right here, Adora."
1,7,14,Catra,Hello? Shadow Weaver?
1,7,14,Catra,"You've been going about this the wrong way, old woman. If you wanna take down Adora, you have to go for the heart."
1,8,0,Adora,"Uh, hey, guys, I got an invite to the All Princess Ball, Winter Wonderland. Do you know what this is?"
1,8,0,Glimmer,Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!
1,8,0,Bow,Princess Prom! Princess Prom! Princess Prom! We are going to Princess Prom!
1,8,0,Adora,"Okay, you've gone crazy, got it. I'll just come back later."
1,8,0,Bow,The ball is a meeting for all the princesses of Etheria.
1,8,0,Glimmer,"And a giant party! Dancing, food, fancy dresses."
1,8,0,Adora,Dancing?
1,8,0,Glimmer,It only happens once a decade. I've been waiting years for this!
1,8,0,Adora,"Uh, I'm only a princess sometimes, so are you sure I should even go?"
1,8,0,Glimmer,Of course! Every princess is invited! That includes you!
1,8,0,Bow,Oh yeah. It's all in the invite.
1,8,0,Adora,"Okay. ""Rules for greeting the hostess. Expected curtsy depth? Proper stair descending etiquette""?"
1,8,0,Bow,The ball has been going on for centuries. There's a lot of really old etiquette stuff you gotta do before you can party.
1,8,0,Glimmer,But it's gonna be so fun! And Princess Frosta is hosting it this year in the Kingdom of Snows! Her magic is incredibly powerful. She'd be a huge get for The Rebellion!
1,8,0,Glimmer,Don't worry! I'll be with you and so will Bow since he's going as my plus one!
1,8,0,Bow,Uh actually--
1,8,0,Glimmer,"Together, the three of us can handle anything."
1,8,0,Bow,About that...
1,8,0,Glimmer,It's the best friend squad in action! Right Bow?
1,8,0,Bow,I'm going with Perfuma.
1,8,0,Glimmer,What!?
1,8,1,Catra,"I'm sick of this. Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora and if Hordak finds out she'll take us down with her. She's obsessed. We need to think big picture. It's time for someone new to take over. Me. So, you in?"
1,8,1,Scorpia,I'm hanging out in your room!
1,8,1,Catra,"Unfortunately, you're the only one I can trust around here."
1,8,1,Scorpia,Because we're best friends.
1,8,1,Catra,"Stop being so you and help me think. I have the beginning of a plan, but it's not enough. I need to capture Adora so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me. I need to impress Hordak so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver. How do I do both?"
1,8,1,Scorpia,"Why don't you try something at the All-Princess Ball? Every princess is gonna be there, so Adora probably will be too. Ooh! This year's theme is Winter Wonderland."
1,8,1,Catra,How did you get your claws on this?
1,8,1,Scorpia,They sent it to me. I'm a princess.
1,8,1,Catra,You're a princess!?
1,8,1,Scorpia,"Yeah, you know. The Horde crash landed in my family's kingdom. We let them stay. My family gave Hordak our runestone, the Black Garnet."
1,8,1,Catra,You're a princess?
1,8,1,Scorpia,"Oh man, I thought everyone knew. I mean, it's covered in Force Captain Orientation."
1,8,1,Catra,"I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have skipped that. Okay, so you're a princess, and you're going to a princess ball."
1,8,1,Scorpia,"Oh no. I'm not going. No. No one liked my family, even before we joined The Horde. I never really fit with the other princesses. I made them uncomfortable and they don't like that. They don't like me."
1,8,1,Catra,And that's exactly why you have to go! How dare they pretend they're better just because you're different! How dare they abandon people just because they don't fit into their perfect little lives!
1,8,1,Scorpia,Yeah!
1,8,1,Catra,How dare they take best friends and turn them into giant sword ladies who run off with people clearly inferior to you?
1,8,1,Scorpia,You're telling my whole life with your words.
1,8,1,Catra,"It's time to show those princesses a thing or two! You're going, I'm coming as your plus one and we'll make this a night no one will ever forget!"
1,8,1,Scorpia,Super Pal Duo is going to prom!
1,8,2,Bow,She asked and I said yes. I didn't think it would be a big deal.
1,8,2,Glimmer,It's not. It's fine. I'm just surprised. When did you two even talk about it?
1,8,2,Bow,"Oh, she was super slick."
1,8,3,Perfuma,Wanna go to the ball with me?
1,8,3,Bow,Okay!
1,8,4,Glimmer,That's super slick?
1,8,4,Bow,I thought it'd be fun. And Perfuma's cool.
1,8,4,Glimmer,"Yeah, she's fine. But we always go to events together. We have our whole routine. We wear matching outfits, we share inside jokes and then we eat ice cream afterwards. It's our thing."
1,8,4,Bow,"Well, there's nothing wrong with a new thing. Look,  I gotta get ready. We'll hang out with you guys there."
1,8,4,Glimmer,But I liked our old thing.
1,8,4,Adora,"Glimmer! Good. No time to waste! I've been studying the invite. I think advance prep will be key to success. So, I've divided the rules into base parts. Dance rules, etiquette rules, rules for greeting the hostess."
1,8,4,Adora,I then broke down the ballroom into quadrants and I'm familiarizing myself with targets. Ask me anything.
1,8,4,Glimmer,Princess Frosta.
1,8,4,Adora,"Ruler of The Kingdom of Snows, it's her first time hosting the ball,  has the biggest kingdom outside of Bright Moon, neutral in the fight against the Horde. Allies with the Star Sisters who are friends with Mermista, but not Sweet Bee who is dating Peekablue as you can tell by the string. Up means friends, down means frenemies. And also, I made an obstacle course! I'm feeling good! I'm prepared for any and all possible scenarios. I am so ready for this Ball."
1,8,4,Glimmer,Great! What are you wearing?
1,8,4,Adora,"I was just gonna go as She-Ra. I mean, she has better hair."
1,8,4,Glimmer,"Well, you can't go as She-Ra. They have a strict no weapons rule. Neutral ground and all. So, you'll have to leave your sword at the door."
1,8,4,Adora,"Ugh, how are there still more parts to this invite?"
1,8,4,Glimmer,You know what this means?
1,8,4,Adora,That clothes aren't important and I should keep studying?
1,8,4,Glimmer,It's makeover time!!
1,8,5,Adora,You gotta be careful and don't just lean it somewhere and don't keep it with the other swords or it might get confused!
1,8,5,Glimmer,"Adora, c'mon!"
1,8,5,Adora,Whoa. Heh. It's big.
1,8,5,Glimmer,"The ball is one of our most ancient traditions. A princess' first ball is a huge rite of passage. Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big."
1,8,5,Adora,"Which is why we need Frosta. If she joins us, all the other princesses are sure to follow."
1,8,5,Adora,Here we go.
1,8,5,Adora,"Hold for one, two and three."
1,8,5,Adora,"That's Frosta? But she's like, 10!"
1,8,5,Frosta,I'm eleven and three quarters.
1,8,5,Glimmer,"Revered hostess, we come into your hall under the ancient rules of hospitality, bringing greetings from Bright Moon. And She-Ra, the legendary warrior."
1,8,5,Frosta,You are welcome in the Kingdom of Snows under the ancient rules of hospitality. Leave conflict at the door and please enjoy the ball.
1,8,5,Adora,Thank you your-- majesty.
1,8,5,Adora,Couldn't have mentioned that she was a little kid?
1,8,5,Glimmer,"You did all that research. I assumed you knew. You know what? It's fine. There's plenty of time still to win her over. Now come on, let's rock this ball"
1,8,5,Adora,Oh! There's Entrapta! Heh.
1,8,6,Entrapta,Adora! Glimmer! Are you here to watch the social experiment too?
1,8,6,Adora,Social experiment?
1,8,6,Entrapta,Different groups are thrown together and forced to mingle. Hierarchies form and break. It's the perfect place to observe behavior. And they have tiny food!
1,8,6,Entrapta,Where's Bow? I wanna show him my new recorder.
1,8,6,Glimmer,He's coming later.
1,8,6,Entrapta,Why didn't he come with you? Aren't you two friends?
1,8,6,Glimmer,Why would you think we're not?
1,8,6,Entrapta,There he is! Bow!
1,8,6,Glimmer,They're matching. That's our best friend thing!
1,8,6,Entrapta,Feelings seem to be getting hurt.
1,8,6,Mermista,"Hey, I'm here too. Don't make a big thing out of it."
1,8,6,Glimmer,They're making up their own inside jokes? What? Is Perfuma his new best friend now?
1,8,6,Mermista,Not gonna get into whatever is happening there.
1,8,6,Entrapta,People just walking around in circles.
1,8,6,Mermista,"Or that. Look, have you seen--?"
1,8,6,Other,"She's a beauty can't you see? She's attending this with me! She's my princess of the sea! Mermista! Oh hey, it's my crew."
1,8,6,Adora,"So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?"
1,8,6,Mermista,"No. He is just my ride. Okay? Just. My. Ride,"
1,8,6,Sea Hawk,Of course. I am her plus one.
1,8,6,Entrapta,This is the best social experiment I've ever been to!
1,8,6,Mermista,Whatever. Do they have a kelp bar here?
1,8,6,Sea Hawk,"To the buffet! Adventu-- Oh hi, Bow."
1,8,6,Adora,Hey--
1,8,6,Glimmer,"That's so funny, Adora! What a funny inside joke the two of us just came up with!"
1,8,6,Perfuma,"The She-Ra, Glimmer. It's great to see you."
1,8,6,Bow,Perfuma was just telling me about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria and then flew away. Sound familiar?
1,8,6,Glimmer,"Sure, whatever. Isn't this fun? Adora and I are having such a great time here together, just the two of us. Right, Adora?"
1,8,6,Bow,"Okay. Uh, we're gonna go say hi to people. Wanna come?"
1,8,6,Glimmer,"No, you guys go on. We'll find you later. I wanna hear the rest of this hilarious story that Adora was just telling!"
1,8,6,Adora,"Oh, perfect. Frosta's alone. I'm gonna try to smooth things over with her. Coming? Okay, never mind. I'll be right back."
1,8,7,Adora,Revered hostess.
1,8,7,Adora,I've come to apologize for earlier. I was so rude.
1,8,7,Frosta,"Yes, you were. But as you're only an honorary princess, you can't be expected to know better."
1,8,7,Adora,Your kingdom is truly beautiful Princess Frosta. I'm honored to be here.
1,8,7,Frosta,Thank you. And now I expect you're going to ask me to join your Rebellion?
1,8,7,Adora,You know about that?
1,8,7,Frosta,Of course I do. Princesses talk you know.
1,8,7,Frosta,The snow peas and the cookies are touching. Do it right.
1,8,7,Adora,"Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you. Your kingdom is the largest and most powerful. Your alliance could be the key to defeating the Horde."
1,8,7,Frosta,The Horde hasn't threatened us here.
1,8,7,Adora,"Only because the Kingdom of Snows is so out of the way, it doesn't matter to Hordak right now. Joining the Rebellion is your best bet."
1,8,7,Frosta,The kingdom of Snows has defended itself perfectly well for thousands of years. We do not need your help or your Rebellion. Please continue to enjoy the ball.
1,8,8,Bow,Perfuma was just telling about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria!
1,8,8,Glimmer,Where have you been?
1,8,8,Adora,"I told you, winning over Frosta. Actually, scratch that, failing to win over Frosta."
1,8,8,Adora,Are you okay? Why does it bother you so much?
1,8,8,Glimmer,"It doesn't! Bow can hang out with whoever he wants. I just I never had that many friends, okay? It's always been just me and Bow. But now, what if he likes his new friends better than me? What if everyone does?"
1,8,8,Adora,"That's not gonna happen, Glimmer. Trust me, Bow isn't the type to leave his old friends behind and neither am..."
1,8,8,Adora,...I.
1,8,9,Adora,"Revered hostess, you can't let them in. They're from the Horde."
1,8,9,Catra,"Revered hostess, Princess Scorpia was invited as per the rules of this ball. Rules which I personally have the upmost respect for."
1,8,9,Adora,You do not!
1,8,9,Frosta,Princess Adora. The rules state clearly that all princesses and their chosen guests are welcome.
1,8,9,Adora,They're up to something. I can feel it. You have to--
1,8,9,Frosta,"That's enough! You look at me and see a child, but I have worked too hard to gain respect only to throw it away just because you feel they are up to something. For centuries the All-Princess Ball has been neutral ground. I will not dishonor that legacy. Scorpia is a princess. Princesses get plus ones. They stay."
1,8,9,Frosta,Teenagers.
1,8,9,Catra,"Really, Adora? I'm shocked. We're not breaking any rules. Didn't you read the invite?"
1,8,9,Adora,"I know you're plotting something. From now until the second the ball ends, I'll be watching. Wherever the two of you go, I go."
1,8,9,Catra,Suit yourself. Have fun with following us!
1,8,9,Adora,"Glimmer, you get Scorpia, I'll take Catra."
1,8,10,Scorpia,"Mm. Mm. Wow, that is good. Oh what is-- I don't even know what's in this. What? Sir? Garcon? What's in this?"
1,8,10,Glimmer,Bow! Wait up!
1,8,10,Bow,Glimmer. Hi.
1,8,10,Glimmer,"There's something I need to tell you. I know things between us have been weird all night. So, I just wanted to say.."
1,8,10,Bow,It's all right. I accept your--
1,8,10,Glimmer,I forgive you.
1,8,10,Bow,"You forgive me? Glimmer, I'm allowed to hang out with other people."
1,8,10,Glimmer,"B-b-but don't you see? That's how it starts! Then suddenly everyone has new friends and nobody needs me anymore. And then, I'm all alone."
1,8,10,Bow,"What are you talking about? You have me, plus Adora and everyone who joined the Rebellion."
1,8,10,Glimmer,"That's what I'm talking about. It used to be the two of us. And now, everything's changing. I don't want you to leave me behind."
1,8,10,Bow,"No one is leaving you behind. I wanted to hang out with you and Adora and Perfuma tonight. But you're the one who keeps acting weird and leaving. I know change is scary, Glimmer. But that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get my cummerbund because it is freezing in here! We'll talk later, okay?"
1,8,11,Entrapta,"Princess Prom, hour two... 37 minutes..."
1,8,11,Adora,Don't touch her!
1,8,11,Entrapta,You're right. This is a much better vantage point for my observations. Hi Adora. Have you met my new assistant? She brought snacks.
1,8,11,Catra,She stole my food then asked me to spy on people with her. Is this what love feels like?
1,8,11,Adora,"Entrapta, she's from the Horde."
1,8,11,Adora,The people the Rebellion are fighting. The Rebellion you're a part of!
1,8,11,Entrapta,"Oh. Well, in that case we should keep a better eye on her 'cause she just walked away."
1,8,12,Bow,Is that a-- Oh no! Princess Scorpia is planting heat bombs! We have to stop her!
1,8,12,Bow,What are you doing? Let me go! Let--
1,8,13,Frosta,"It is my solemn duty as hostess to now announce, it is time for the first dance of the Ball."
1,8,13,Catra,"I don't know about you, but I am having a blast."
1,8,13,Adora,"Whatever it is you're planning, it won't work."
1,8,13,Catra,You sure?
1,8,13,Glimmer,I got into a fight with Bow and he won't wanna be friends with me anymore and I don't know where Scorpia is!
1,8,13,Adora,What? Glimmer don't--
1,8,13,Perfuma,"Have you seen Bow? He went to get his cummerbund, but that was a while ago, right about the same time that Horde princess left."
1,8,13,Adora,"Wait, do you mean Scorpia?"
1,8,13,Adora,"Glimmer, when did you last see Bow?"
1,8,13,Glimmer,A while ago. Isn't he with Perfuma?
1,8,13,Adora,No. Perfuma says he's been gone this entire time.
1,8,13,Catra,"Maybe my plan won't work. But then again, maybe it already has."
1,8,13,Catra,"Say, where's your friend, Bow?"
1,8,13,Adora,What did you do to him!?
1,8,13,Catra,Nothing permanent.
1,8,13,Adora,Tell me what you did with him right--
1,8,13,Adora,"Revered hostess, she's got--"
1,8,13,Frosta,Princess Ball is a ceremony of unity. Violence is strictly forbidden.
1,8,13,Adora,You don't understand.
1,8,13,Frosta,"I understand perfectly. As hostess, in accordance with the rules set down over the centuries, I hereby revoke your invitation. You are to leave my kingdom and never, ever--"
1,8,13,Frosta,Remain calm! Stop!
1,8,13,Adora,Glimmer! Catra has Bow. You have to find him now!
1,8,13,Adora,Catra. What did you do?
1,8,13,Catra,"I did nothing. Scorpia, Lonnie and Kyle on the other hand were very busy. It was fun distracting you though."
1,8,13,Adora,This isn't a game! People are gonna get hurt!
1,8,13,Catra,"It's never been a game to me. I'm after something bigger, and no one is going to stop me."
1,8,14,Glimmer,Bow? Bow! Where are you?
1,8,14,Glimmer,Get away from him!
1,8,14,Glimmer,No!
1,8,15,Adora,Ha. Trapped.
1,8,15,Catra,You wish.
1,8,15,Adora,Hang on! I can get us out of this!
1,8,15,Catra,"Oh, Adora. I don't want you to."
1,8,15,Adora,Catra!
1,8,15,Catra,"See you later, princess."
1,9,1,Catra,"Check this thing out. You've got to admit, Shadow Weaver, in a single mission, I inflicted more damage on the Rebellion than anyone else. I succeeded where even you failed."
1,9,1,Hordak,Shadow Weaver.
1,9,1,Shadow Weaver,My Lord.
1,9,1,Hordak,I commend you on the capture of the Princess of Bright Moon. Queen Angella has been given until the mornings moonrise to surrender herself to our forces.
1,9,1,Shadow Weaver,"Thank-you, Lord Hordak. I thought you would be please with my work."
1,9,1,Hordak,You have proven your worth to me. Today.
1,9,1,Catra,Your worth? I'm the one who brought back the Princess of Bright Moon. Not you.
1,9,1,Shadow Weaver,"You're under my command, Force Captain. Therefore anything you manage to do right is credited to me."
1,9,1,Catra,"So, I do all the work and you get the glory?"
1,9,1,Shadow Weaver,Sometimes that just the way of things.
1,9,1,Shadow Weaver,"Welcome to the Fright Zone, Princess."
1,9,2,Adora,Your Majesty?
1,9,2,Angella,"I should never have let her leave this castle. And now, I'm faced with an impossible position. As leader of the Rebellion, how can I surrender myself to our enemy? And yet, as a mother, how do I... I'm going to accept Hordak's terms. Glimmer is all I have."
1,9,2,Adora,You can't. We have no guarantee the Horde will hold up their end of the bargain. We could end up losing you too.
1,9,2,Angella,"A rescue attempt is too risky. If we had She-Ra we might have a chance, but without the Sword of Protection..."
1,9,2,Adora,There has to be another way. We can't just give up. I can rescue them. I know the Fright Zone. I'll find a way to get them back.
1,9,2,Angella,How are you going to do that?
1,9,2,Adora,"I... I don't know yet. But I'll think of something, I promise. I'll bring them home."
1,9,2,Adora,Huh? What are you all doing here?
1,9,2,Mermista,We're the Princess Alliance. And the Horde took one of our own.
1,9,2,Perfuma,We're ready for our first mission.
1,9,2,Adora,Let's go get our friends back.
1,9,3,Kyle,"Dinner rations, prisoner."
1,9,3,Kyle,Ow!
1,9,3,Bow,"Hey, what's your name?"
1,9,3,Kyle,Me? You're talking to me?
1,9,3,Bow,Sure. Is that all right?
1,9,3,Kyle,"Uh, I guess, but no one ever talks to me. I'm Kyle."
1,9,3,Bow,"Hey, Kyle, I'm Bow. Can you do me a favor? Can you tell me where they're holding the princess?"
1,9,3,Kyle,Princess?
1,9,3,Bow,She's my best friend. No one will let me talk to her or even tell me if she's okay.
1,9,3,Kyle,I'm sure she's fine. Maybe. Or she's not. I don't know.
1,9,3,Bow,Do you know where she is?
1,9,3,Kyle,"No, that kind of information is classified. They wouldn't tell me."
1,9,3,Bow,You have to help me get a message to her.
1,9,3,Kyle,"I, uh. I better be leaving now."
1,9,3,Bow,"No, wait."
1,9,3,Kyle,I like your shirt!
1,9,3,Bow,Kyle!
1,9,4,Adora,"Okay. This is the Horde prison. Glimmer and Bow are being held inside. Entrapta, this perfume bottle is you. Perfuma, you're the nail polish. Mermista, lipstick."
1,9,4,Mermista,Ew. Do you know what that stuff is made of? I'll be this knife.
1,9,4,Entrapta,I feel like Perfuma should be the perfume bottle. That makes the most logical sense.
1,9,4,Perfuma,Maybe I could be a flower.
1,9,4,Sea Hawk,Could I be this miniature painted model of Bow?
1,9,4,Adora,"No! Those represent Bow and Glimmer. And this one's mine. Bow made them for us. Okay, just... Everyone focus! Our entry point will be here, near the Horde's scrapyard. It's close to the prison and lightly guarded. Perfuma and Entrapta will access the security tower and wait for my signal to disable the lights. Mermista will access the Fright Zone's sewer system. She'll swim through the pipes into the building and open the door."
1,9,4,Mermista,"I'm sorry, Mermista will what?"
1,9,4,Adora,"I know it sounds bad, but your'e the only one who can breathe underwater."
1,9,4,Mermista,Super gross.
1,9,4,Adora,Sea Hawk and I will take up position by the entrance. The two of us will neutralize any guards on patrol. Entrpata and Perfuma will regroup on our position and the team will enter when Mermista opens the door.
1,9,4,Sea Hawk,Excellent plan. Adventure!
1,9,5,Mermista,Hm?
1,9,6,Adora,Mermista should be in place now.
1,9,6,Perfuma,Adora's signal.
1,9,6,Entrapta,"Fright Zone log, day one. I can barely contain my excitement! Hahaha. Hmm, the Horde's using an outdated wiring system. It really would work so much better if I just consolidated these conduits and re-routed the current here..."
1,9,6,Perfuma,Entrapta? Now would be a good time for those lights.
1,9,6,Entrapta,"Oh, right."
1,9,6,Other,What happened?
1,9,6,Adora,We go on three. Ready? One...
1,9,6,Sea Hawk,Forward!
1,9,6,Adora,I said on three.
1,9,6,Sea Hawk,I got excited.
1,9,6,Sea Hawk,Where's Mermista?
1,9,6,Adora,"She must've gotten held up. Come on, we need to secure the guards."
1,9,6,Perfuma,Entrapta? Entrapta?
1,9,6,Entrapta,"The subject appears to be harvesting scrap components, possibly for reuse. Fascinating."
1,9,6,Perfuma,Entrapta? We're supposed to meet with the others.
1,9,6,Entrapta,"I know, I was waiting for you."
1,9,6,Perfuma,"Oh, how very considerate. Let's go."
1,9,6,Entrapta,"Ah, oh."
1,9,6,Perfuma,So we don't get separated.
1,9,6,Adora,Psst.
1,9,6,Scorpia,Halt! Who are you?
1,9,6,Sea Hawk,Me? I'm the inspector. I'm here to inspect all the things.
1,9,6,Scorpia,"Inspector? Inspector, of course! I must have forgotten you were coming. We're long overdue for an inspection, I do have to admit it, but I can assure you we are up to code."
1,9,6,Adora,Wha...? How did this happen? We had a plan.
1,9,6,Entrapta,Actually you kind of lost me at the perfume bottle.
1,9,6,Adora,Where have you two been?
1,9,6,Perfuma,I tried to get here sooner but harmonious teamwork with Entrapta can be...a challenge.
1,9,6,Adora,This isn't a game. It's the Horde. Glimmer and Bow are being held captive in this building and now Sea Hawk is gone.
1,9,6,Perfuma,"Okay. All right, everyone calm down. Maybe we could try a simple breathing exercise. Deep calming breaths, hmmmm."
1,9,6,Adora,"Come on, we're going in."
1,9,6,Mermista,Could you not?
1,9,6,Adora,Huh? What happened to you?
1,9,6,Mermista,"Uh, the sewer happened to me."
1,9,6,Adora,We can't waste any more time. Bow and Glimmer need us.
1,9,6,Mermista,"Uh, can I get a thank-you?"
1,9,6,Adora,Thank-you.
1,9,6,Adora,We need to get to an information port. I'll hack into the data base and identify the cell block Glimmer and Bow are being held in.
1,9,6,Mermista,"Hey, where's the geeky princess?"
1,9,6,Perfuma,"Okay, she is really putting a crimp in my harmony!"
1,9,6,Adora,Don't worry. We'll find Entrapta and Sea Hawk and we'll rescue Glimmer and Bow.
1,9,6,Mermista,"I don't know, that sounds like a lot. But you know me, I'm totally up for anything."
1,9,6,Entrapta,"Fright Zone log, day one continued. Keypads appear in every corridor and are capable of giving status updates on multiple systems."
1,9,6,Entrapta,Wow. Hello there little guy.
1,9,6,Entrapta,"Well, hello to you too."
1,9,7,Shadow Weaver,"I should warn you Princess. Any attempt to teleport through these restraints will only cause you pain. It seems my Black Garnet and your powers don't mix. Besides, your mother will be here soon."
1,9,7,Glimmer,"I know all about you and your mind games, Shadow Weaver. Adora told me, so save it! And, by the way, she's not a fan."
1,9,7,Shadow Weaver,"But I'm not playing games. What I said about Queen Angella is true. She's coming to surrender herself in exchange for your safety. Oh, it's such a shame, the toll this rebellion has taken on your family. First you lose your father..."
1,9,7,Glimmer,She-Ra will stop you!
1,9,7,Shadow Weaver,There is no She-Ra! We have the sword. Not Adora. There will be no one left to stop the Horde. In a few hours Bright Moon will fall and Etheria will be ours to rule.
1,9,7,Shadow Weaver,"Oh, tsk-tsk. Careful now. It would be a shame if we had no princess to exchange for the Queen."
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,"Well, you Horde types run a tight ship, I must say. Everything seems up to code. Yes indeed, entirely up to code. You pass with flying colors. Now, unless you have something else for me to inspect, I should get home to my inspector children."
1,9,8,Scorpia,"You know, you look familiar."
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,"Perhaps you've seen me, in your dreams?"
1,9,8,Scorpia,"No, that's not it. Princess Prom. That's where I know you from. I knew it would come to me. You were with that mermaid."
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,"She has a name you know! I mean, no, that wasn't me."
1,9,8,Scorpia,You're with the Rebellion.
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,"Now, as a scrupulous inspector, threats normally wouldn't work on me. But in this case, uh, perhaps we can reach a compromise? ""Duck?"""
1,9,8,Scorpia,"Oh, where?"
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,Oh! Duck!
1,9,8,Entrapta,Hi.
1,9,8,Sea Hawk,Oh! That was a top-notch rescue.
1,9,8,Entrapta,To be honest I wasn't sure which one of you I was gonna hit.
1,9,9,Adora,"Okay, I found Bow's cell, but I can't find Glimmer in here anywhere. They must be holding her somewhere else. This isn't good."
1,9,9,Perfuma,What should we do?
1,9,9,Mermista,I'm not going back in the sewer.
1,9,9,Entrapta,"It's okay. This is my new friend, Emily. I reprogrammed her."
1,9,9,Perfuma,Where have you been?
1,9,9,Entrapta,Where have you been?
1,9,9,Adora,It doesn't matter. We're all together. Let's finish this.
1,9,9,Adora,"Bow's cell is in section B, level 20. We'll get him out first then figure out where Glimmer is. Entrapta, can you get us up there?"
1,9,9,Entrapta,"Yes! I can. I mean, maybe. I don't know. I'm definitely gonna try. This is gonna be fun!"
1,9,9,Adora,"Okay, Sea Hawk, Perfuma you're with me."
1,9,9,Mermista,"I'll keep an eye on this one, in case she tries to befriend any more robots."
1,9,9,Sea Hawk,On to the rescue!
1,9,10,Kyle,Bow. Bow!
1,9,10,Bow,Kyle?
1,9,10,Kyle,I'm supposed to be in the barracks. Lonnie made me cover her latrine duty.
1,9,10,Bow,What's going on?
1,9,10,Kyle,I found out where your friend is being kept. Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber.
1,9,10,Bow,"Oh, that sounds bad."
1,9,10,Kyle,"Yeah, it's pretty bad. But she's alive, at least. Shadow Weaver is planning to ransom her in exchange for Queen."
1,9,10,Bow,Why are you telling me this?
1,9,10,Kyle,"I don't know. I guess, because your the first person who's ever listened to me."
1,9,10,Bow,"I mean, I'm being held prisoner, so... I don't know that I have a choice, but sure!"
1,9,11,Entrapta,Whoops. That's not right.
1,9,11,Adora,Entrapta!
1,9,11,Sea Hawk,Perfuma! Hmm?
1,9,11,Adora,Hang on!
1,9,11,Lonnie,You think you can just come back here?
1,9,11,Adora,I need to save my friends.
1,9,11,Lonnie,We were your friends.
1,9,11,Sea Hawk,Huh?
1,9,11,Perfuma,"Adora, are you all right?"
1,9,11,Adora,Thanks to you.
1,9,11,Sea Hawk,"Great hit, Perfuma."
1,9,11,Kyle,"No one's ever, ever asked for my help before. People here don't think I can do anything right."
1,9,11,Bow,Um-hm. That seems tough.
1,9,11,Kyle,Why am I telling you this? I shouldn't even be here. I'm going to get into so much trouble if I get caught.
1,9,11,Bow,"No! Wait, I mean we're just talking. How much trouble could you get in for talking?"
1,9,11,Kyle,"Oh, you'd be surprised. I get in trouble for everything around here."
1,9,11,Bow,That doesn't seem fair.
1,9,11,Kyle,"I know! But then I thought how brave you are for wanting to save your friend. And maybe, if I helped you, you could be my friend too."
1,9,11,Bow,"Uh, sure, friends, definitely. We can be friends."
1,9,11,Entrapta,"Good team, geek princess."
1,9,11,Sea Hawk,Goodbye!
1,9,11,Sea Hawk,Bow! We're here to save you.
1,9,11,Bow,Adora!
1,9,11,Adora,"Bow! Bow, where's Glimmer?"
1,9,11,Bow,"Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber. Adora, what are we gonna do?"
1,9,11,Adora,Come on.
1,9,11,Adora,Can you get it open?
1,9,11,Entrapta,I just need a little more time.
1,9,11,Adora,"This vent system leads to where you can steal a skiff. Each chamber needs to be sealed and purged before you can move on to the next one. The doors will only stay open for a few seconds, so keep up the pace."
1,9,11,Bow,"Adora, what are you doing?"
1,9,11,Adora,"Don't worry about me. I'm gonna buy you some time and find Glimmer. Meet you there, okay?"
1,9,11,Bow,Adora!
1,9,11,Adora,"I surrender, take me to see Shadow Weaver."
1,9,11,Adora,"Glimmer, I'm here. Don't worry everything will be okay. I'll save you. What have you done to her?"
1,9,11,Shadow Weaver,"Leave us. Report to the Force Captain barracks and pack your things. Now that Adora is back, there's no need for you there."
1,9,11,Catra,"Seriously? After everything I've done for you, it's still her you want?"
1,9,11,Shadow Weaver,I said go!
1,9,11,Adora,"Shadow Weaver, I'll stay here with you willingly, but you have to let Glimmer go first."
1,9,11,Glimmer,"Adora, no."
1,9,11,Adora,"Glimmer, are you okay?"
1,9,11,Shadow Weaver,"You are correct Adora. You shall stay willingly, because I am going to wipe your mind. You'll have no memory of She-Ra or the time you spent with the Rebellion. Everything will be as it once was. As for the Princess, once I'm done, you'll be happy to have her as your prisoner."
1,9,11,Glimmer,No! Adora!
1,9,12,Bow,We need to go back for Glimmer and Adora.
1,9,12,Perfuma,We need to do what Adora said. They'll make it out and we'll be ready with the skiff. No princess will be left behind.
1,9,13,Glimmer,"Adora, are you okay? Do you know who I am?"
1,9,13,Adora,Glimmer.
1,9,14,Sea Hawk,We made it. This way to the vehicle bay.
1,9,14,Entrapta,Wait. Emily.
1,9,14,Perfuma,Entrapta! No!
1,9,15,Adora,"Glimmer, what's happening?"
1,9,15,Glimmer,I don't know. I can't teleport.
1,9,15,Adora,What?
1,9,15,Adora,Catra. What are you doing?
1,9,15,Catra,Take it. This is not because I like you.
1,9,15,Adora,"Catra, I..."
1,9,15,Catra,Just get out of here.
1,9,15,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,9,16,Bow,There they are.
1,9,16,Bow,Glimmer.
1,9,16,Adora,"Wait, where's Entrapta?"
1,9,16,Bow,Entrapta didn't make it.
1,9,16,Adora,What do you mean?
1,9,16,Mermista,She's gone.
1,9,16,Adora,"Well, then, we have to go back for her."
1,9,16,Bow,"No, she's... She's really gone."
1,10,0,Adora,How could I let this happen?
1,10,0,Bow,"Adora, it's not your fault."
1,10,0,Adora,It IS my fault. Entrapta's gone because of my plan.
1,10,0,Mermista,This only happened because we were all together.
1,10,0,Perfuma,"Mermista's right, being together makes us vulnerable."
1,10,0,Mermista,Maybe there's a reason the Princess Alliance fell apart before. Maybe this whole thing was a bad idea.
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Mermista, no, you can't say that."
1,10,0,Mermista,"Whatever. I don't want to be a part of it anymore. Sea Hawk, take me home."
1,10,0,Angella,"Oh, Glimmer!"
1,10,0,Angella,Are you hurt?
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Mom, you're crushing me."
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Mom, I'm fine, cut it out!"
1,10,0,Angella,I will not cut it out. I've been beside myself with worry.
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Nothing, I just need to recharge. That's all."
1,10,0,Angella,"Of course, Guards, carry my daughter to the Moonstone Chamber at once."
1,10,0,Glimmer,"I don't need to be carried, I can walk. You're embarrassing me."
1,10,0,Angella,Fine. Then you have time to tell me what happened. I received word of Entrapta's loss.
1,10,0,Angella,"Well, Glimmer? Bow? Adora? Someone tell me what happened."
1,10,0,Adora,"-Commander, it's my fault."
1,10,0,Bow,-The thing is...
1,10,0,Glimmer,-Leave my friends alone! Give us a minute.
1,10,0,Angella,"A minute? You were being held by the Horde. I've been going mad, telling myself awful stories about what could've happened to you."
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Jeeze, mom, relax. I'm fine. We'll talk later."
1,10,0,Angella,This conversation isn't over!
1,10,0,Adora,I'm— I'm sorry.
1,10,0,Adora,It's happening more often.
1,10,0,Bow,Does it hurt?
1,10,0,Glimmer,"No, not much."
1,10,0,Bow,We need to tell your mom. She'll know what to do.
1,10,0,Glimmer,No!
1,10,0,Adora,"Glimmer, Shadow Weaver did something to your powers. You can't teleport and, whatever this is, keeps happening."
1,10,0,Glimmer,"I don't want my mom freaking out anymore than she already is. Okay? Besides, I always feel better after I recharge, so..."
1,10,0,Glimmer,"Then it's agreed. I'll recharge, stop glitching. Then my mom never has to know."
1,10,1,Hordak,"Not only did you lose the princess known as Glimmer, but I've learned that you've known Adora was She-Ra all along."
1,10,1,Shadow Weaver,Now you see why I felt it was so important to bring her back.
1,10,1,Hordak,"All you did was invite attack from an enemy combatant with detailed knowledge of our operations. If I had known, I never would have agreed to your foolish plan."
1,10,1,Catra,"Yeah, bad plan."
1,10,1,Scorpia,Wasn't it your—? Oh!
1,10,2,Glimmer,I can feel you watching me.
1,10,2,Bow,I am not.
1,10,2,Glimmer,"See, I told you. Just needed to re—"
1,10,2,Glimmer,It didn't work.
1,10,2,Bow,Work? It made it worse.
1,10,2,Angella,Glimmer? Are you up there?
1,10,2,Adora,"Uh, guys? We have a problem."
1,10,2,Glimmer,We cannot let my mom see me like this!
1,10,2,Angella,"There you are, Glimmer. Are you feeling better?"
1,10,2,Glimmer,"Whoa, Mom, can't a girl recharge in private? Anyway, we were just leaving. Bye!"
1,10,2,Angella,"Is everything all right? Glimmer? Glimmer, do not walk away from me. I just wanted to talk."
1,10,3,Catra,"Boy, Hordak really let Shadow Weaver have it. Did you see the look on her face?"
1,10,3,Scorpia,"Yes. Well, I mean, I think. It's kinda hard to tell with the mask and all."
1,10,3,Catra,"Serves her right. If she wants to take credit for my plans, she can take the blame, too."
1,10,3,Scorpia,-Oh! What is it?
1,10,3,Catra,Shh.
1,10,3,Scorpia,"Oh, sorry. What is it?"
1,10,3,Scorpia,"Yeah. Yeah, that's— That's concrete."
1,10,3,Entrapta,Hii-
1,10,4,Glimmer,Maybe it's like a cold. I've never been sick before. Having an immortal mother has some advantages. What do you do when you have a cold?
1,10,4,Adora,Remain out of sight.
1,10,4,Adora,"What? Displays of physical weakness are strongly discouraged in the Horde. And they're right. I haven't been training enough, and look what happened!"
1,10,4,Bow,"Stop it, Adora. They're not right. Okay, cold. Um... Lots of liquids and, uh, rest. I'll make soup!"
1,10,4,Glimmer,"Great, and I'll nap. I bet when I wake up I'll be as good as new. Yeah, just gotta let it run its course."
1,10,4,Glimmer,Why did I make my bed so high? Give me a boost?
1,10,4,Adora,We're not letting anything run its course. You're getting worse.
1,10,4,Glimmer,"No, I'm not. Okay, maybe a little."
1,10,4,Adora,"Look, you got sick because of whatever dark magic Shadow Weaver made with the black garnet. Maybe the sword can heal you. She-Ra healed the trees in Plumeria."
1,10,4,Bow,"Uh... Sort of, not really."
1,10,4,Adora,"Well, She-Ra definitely fixed the Sea Gate."
1,10,4,Bow,Glimmer's not a piece of machinery. And you don't know how to fully control She-Ra's powers yet. No offense.
1,10,4,Glimmer,"This is a great idea. She-Ra will fix me, and then everything will be back to normal. Mm-hmm. How hard can it be?"
1,10,4,Bow,Did no one hear what I just..?
1,10,4,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
1,10,5,Catra,Prisoner.
1,10,5,Scorpia,That's Entrapta.
1,10,5,Catra,"I know her name, I was just— Ugh, never mind. Lord Hordak himself tasked me with your interrogation. So, there's no use resisting."
1,10,5,Catra,I don't care what it takes. I'm going to drag the Rebellion's plans out of you.
1,10,5,Entrapta,Ooh! What's that?
1,10,5,Catra,What? Hey!
1,10,5,Scorpia,"Catra! Oh, oh, there you go."
1,10,5,Entrapta,Fascinating!
1,10,5,Catra,Give it back!
1,10,5,Entrapta,"Oh, I like that thing. Can I have it?"
1,10,5,Catra,"No! And stop, I'm interrogating you!"
1,10,5,Entrapta,"Well, okay, then. What do you want to know?"
1,10,5,Catra,Why were you hiding out in the Fright Zone?
1,10,5,Entrapta,"I was waiting for my friends to get back. They had trouble finding me before. So, I figured I'd make it easier for them and just stay put right here."
1,10,5,Catra,They left you.
1,10,5,Entrapta,"No, no, they're my friends, they'll be back."
1,10,5,Entrapta,"Say, your tail secretes some kind of paralyzing agent, right? Do you think I could have a sample, to study?"
1,10,5,Scorpia,"Hey, you can't just touch another woman's tail without asking!"
1,10,5,Catra,"Some friends. They left you, and they're not coming back. Isn't that just like Adora? She left me behind, too. Like I was nothing."
1,10,5,Scorpia,"And me. I mean, I didn't want to go, but she could've at least asked."
1,10,5,Catra,"Adora got her precious Bow and Glimmer back. All these princesses care about is people who are just like them. But you're not like them, are you?"
1,10,5,Entrapta,"Fright Zone log, hour 45. Is that right? I don't know if that's right, it was hard to tell in the walls. Hour 45, that's— That's too many hours. This angry feline person seems to be correct. They're not coming back for me."
1,10,5,Catra,"You wouldn't have to pretend to be something you're not with the Horde. Think of what you could accomplish here. What we could accomplish, together."
1,10,5,Entrapta,I've made more progress on my work in secret here than I did in a whole non-secret life out there. They should see. Horde technology gives me SO MUCH to work with. Emily's the most advanced bot I've ever built.
1,10,5,Catra,"Wait, who's Emily?"
1,10,5,Entrapta,"Oh! How rude, allow me to introduce you."
1,10,5,Scorpia,"I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha!"
1,10,5,Catra,Those princesses have no idea who they've left behind.
1,10,6,Adora,The.. Eternia.. Heal! Heal.. Glimmer.
1,10,6,Bow,"Who's ready to stop messing around with sharp objects? Hey, look, I am!"
1,10,6,Glimmer,Maybe if you point it at me?
1,10,6,Bow,"Or, unpopular opinion, don't point a sword directly at our friend."
1,10,6,Adora,"It's fine, I got this."
1,10,6,Glimmer,Maybe it's like a motion? Like a jabbing motion? Or a strike.
1,10,6,Bow,Do you want to get hit with a sword?!
1,10,6,Adora,Can everyone please be quiet? I have it!
1,10,6,Bow,Am I the only one who cares about sword safety around here?
1,10,6,Adora,I think it's working.
1,10,6,Glimmer,"Yup, definitely working. I'm pretty sure I feel something."
1,10,6,Bow,SWORD SAFETY!
1,10,7,Scorpia,"Honestly, I don't think anybody's gonna notice."
1,10,7,Entrapta,Sorry again. About the wall.
1,10,7,Catra,-Don't worry about it.
1,10,7,Entrapta,-You're not mad? People usually get mad.
1,10,7,Catra,"Are you kidding? I'm impressed. You rebuilt that robot, I mean, Emily, all on your own? While living in the vents?"
1,10,7,Entrapta,"Sure did. Not only that, but she's better than ever. Stronger, increased weapons capabilities, and affectionate, too."
1,10,7,Entrapta,"Who knows how much more powerful she could be if I just had access to a little First Ones tech. You don't have any here, do you?"
1,10,7,Catra,-First what?
1,10,7,Entrapta,"-First Ones tech. You know, advanced technology left behind by a lost civilization? Makes our modern innovations look like children's toys? I've been attempting to integrate First Ones tech into my experiments for years, but my understanding of their code is still rudimentary. If I could just find the key to their language, there's no telling what I could build. Such a find could yield almost unlimited power."
1,10,7,Catra,And where would one find this tech?
1,10,7,Entrapta,"It's buried all over the planet. It gives off a signal that can be traced. Lately, I've been tracking the strongest signal I've ever seen. It must be a massive stash."
1,10,7,Catra,-Where?
1,10,7,Scorpia,-Ugh.
1,10,7,Scorpia,Huh.
1,10,7,Catra,"I mean, uh, where?"
1,10,7,Entrapta,"I've triangulated the signal to somewhere in the Whispering Woods. The whole shifting landscape thing makes for a complicated variable, but I've created a map that's accurate within two quadrants."
1,10,7,Catra,How do I get my hands on this map?
1,10,7,Entrapta,"Like any good scientist, I carry everything I need on my person."
1,10,7,Catra,"I'm not sure if we can trust her yet. But if she's telling the truth, this could give us a huge advantage over the Rebellion. Hordak will finally see how much more valuable I am than Shadow Weaver."
1,10,7,Scorpia,I bet he'll promote you to.. To.. What comes after Force Captain?
1,10,7,Catra,Keep an eye on Entrapta while I go see if this pans out.
1,10,7,Entrapta,"I hope it does, I wanna build something bbbiiigggg."
1,10,7,Entrapta,"Oh, sorry, my bad."
1,10,7,Entrapta,Which hair part was in which thingy?
1,10,8,Adora,What good am I if I can't even heal one princess?
1,10,8,Adora,Why even carry a sword?
1,10,8,Glimmer,"Everybody, just act normal."
1,10,8,Glimmer,"Mom, we're busy."
1,10,8,Angella,I won't be long. You are requested for dinner with me tonight. Alone.
1,10,8,Glimmer,But Mom! I'm really tired. Can't I just stay in my room and rest?
1,10,8,Angella,"I'm sorry, I don't know why I said request. It's not a request. You are required to have dinner with me because I'm your mother and.. I'm also the queen, so I can make you."
1,10,8,Bow,Yikes. She's playing the queen card.
1,10,8,Angella,No need to answer. I'll see you in an hour.
1,10,8,Adora,That's it. I can't stay here and be useless. Bow is right. I don't know how to use my powers.
1,10,8,Bow,I didn't say that. Or not that exactly.
1,10,8,Adora,"The Horde has a lot of things wrong. Okay, pretty much everything. But one thing they are right about is training. And how can I train if I don't know anything about She-Ra? I'm going to go somewhere so I can learn. And then I'm gonna fix you, Glimmer."
1,10,8,Glimmer,How? Can you do it in an hour?
1,10,8,Adora,"Probably not, since I'm not totally sure where I'm going. I need to find the place Madame Razz took me. I- it's some sort of beacon. I can't explain it, but I-I know I can get answers there."
1,10,8,Glimmer,Running away. Great idea. Then I won't have to go to dinner with my mom. I'll get my things.
1,10,8,Adora,"No, I have to do this on my own."
1,10,8,Adora,Ow.
1,10,8,Bow,She's okay.
1,10,8,Glimmer,I hope she stays that way.
1,10,9,Shadow Weaver,Going somewhere?
1,10,9,Catra,"Like I'd tell you. I've got a lead on something big, and I'm not about to let you take all the credit again. Not that it worked out so great for you last time."
1,10,9,Catra,"Don't worry about that thing with Hordak. I've got loads of experience being yelled at. Mostly by you, actually. You get used to it."
1,10,9,Shadow Weaver,I will not get used to mediocrity like you. And I certainly don't need your pity.
1,10,9,Shadow Weaver,"I was hard on you, I won't deny it.  And I won't apologize.  I just wanted to prepare you for the world.  I wanted you to be strong."
1,10,9,Catra,"Yeah, well, congratulations.  I'm plenty strong now.  And I don't need you."
1,10,9,Bow,"Listen, Glimmer, I appreciate you trying, but you can't protect me anymore.  We have to tell your mom."
1,10,9,Glimmer,"We're not telling anybody's mom!  And, what do you mean, protect you?"
1,10,9,Bow,"Isn't it obvious?  This is all my fault.  If I hadn't gone to Princess Prom with Perfuma, then we wouldn't have been separated, and then I wouldn't have gotten kidnapped, and you wouldn't be sick.  See?  All my fault!"
1,10,9,Glimmer,"That's crazy.  This is obviously my fault!  I let myself get distracted.  I shouldn't've been so weird about you hanging out with someone else.  I'm sorry, Bow."
1,10,9,Bow,You can't be sorry when I'm tryin' to be sorry.
1,10,9,Glimmer,"Yeah, but your sorry is wrong, and mine is right.  Ya know what?  Let's just hug."
1,10,9,Glimmer,"I'm glitching, aren't I?"
1,10,9,Bow,It hurts . . . so much.
1,10,9,Glimmer,How am I going to get through dinner without my mom noticing?
1,10,9,Glimmer,"We start a fire in the castle, and my mom'll have to cancel!"
1,10,9,Glimmer,Just a small one?
1,10,9,Adora,It was definitely this way.  I think.
1,10,9,Adora,Oh!  That rock looks familiar.
1,10,9,Adora,Because I passed it an hour ago.
1,10,9,Angella,I gave the staff the night off so it could be just us.  And I made your favorite.
1,10,9,Angella,"Well, I didn't make it.  But I had the kitchen make it before I gave them the night off."
1,10,9,Glimmer,Thanks.
1,10,9,Angella,We've hardly had a chance to talk since you returned.
1,10,9,Glimmer,"Well, you know, not much to talk about."
1,10,9,Angella,Not much to talk about?  You were kidnapped!  And you lost a friend when you escaped.  And . . .
1,10,9,Glimmer,"I get it, Mom!  I failed!"
1,10,9,Angella,That's not what I'm . . .
1,10,9,Angella,"Stop!  Make it stop!  Glimmer, what's happening to you?!  What aren't you telling me?!"
1,10,9,Glimmer,"Don't yell at me!  I know I messed everything up, okay?!  I know, I'm a big disappointment!"
1,10,9,Angella,What are you talking about?
1,10,9,Glimmer,"Entrapta died trying to rescue me, and the Princess Alliance is over, and Shadow Weaver did something to my powers!  I'm sorry I couldn't be perfect like you!  You have no idea what it's like to be such a screw-up!!"
1,10,9,Angella,I don't know how you feel?  I got your father killed!
1,10,9,Angella,I ordered the battle that your father perished in.  I've never forgiven myself.
1,10,9,Glimmer,I - I didn't know that.
1,10,9,Angella,"Yes, well . . . you never talk to me.  Why didn't you tell me you were sick?"
1,10,9,Glimmer,Because I was ashamed.  I acted without thinking.  The exact thing you're always telling me not to do.  I teleported right into their trap.  The alliance is over.  And I'm to blame.
1,10,9,Angella,"Oh, Glimmer.  I'm the one who failed.  If I hadn't let the first alliance fall apart after your father's death, none of this would be happening."
1,10,9,Glimmer,You feel like a failure?
1,10,9,Angella,"Don't make the same mistake I did.  I should have kept fighting.  You should, too."
1,10,9,Glimmer,But the other princesses.  They all quit.  You don't think the rebellion is done?
1,10,9,Angella,With my daughter leading it?  Not.  A.  Chance.
1,10,9,Glimmer,Even if my powers are gone?
1,10,9,Angella,We'll figure it out.  Together.
1,10,9,Adora,Nooooo!  I've been walking in a straight line!  I'm trying to help!  Why are you stopping me?!
1,10,9,Catra,I should've known better than to trust a princess!
1,10,9,Adora,"Just let me fix this, please!  I - I can't let anyone else get hurt."
1,10,9,Adora,"Fine.  You win.  You want me to be weak?  Well.  I am.  And I'm afraid.  Because, I - I'm no good at any of this."
1,10,9,Catra,Augh!  I'll never find this “magical tech!”  If it even exists in the first place!
1,10,9,Catra,On second thought . . .
1,10,9,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
1,11,0,Adora,"Hello? I carry the sword of She-Ra, and I've come here for help. Is anyone there?"
1,11,0,Other,"Greetings, administrator. What is your query?"
1,11,0,Adora,"Oh. I need your help to heal my friend. She's been cursed, and I-I don't know how to save her. The legends say that She-Ra could heal people using this sword. How do I do that?"
1,11,0,Other,What is your query?
1,11,0,Adora,Not this again. ...For the honor of Grayskull!
1,11,0,Adora,How about now?
1,11,0,Other,"Administrator detected. Welcome, She-Ra."
1,11,1,Adora,One more time. What can you tell me about this sword?
1,11,1,Other,"Subject: The Sword of Protection. Classification: portable Runestone keyed exclusively to Administrator: She-Ra, Princess of Power."
1,11,1,Adora,How can I use the sword to heal my friend?
1,11,1,Other,Query not recognized.
1,11,1,Adora,The legends say the sword has healing powers. Is that true?
1,11,1,Other,One of the Sword of Protection's many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.
1,11,1,Adora,But how do I do that?
1,11,1,Other,Query not recognized.
1,11,1,Adora,How can I use the sword to heal people?!
1,11,1,Other,One of the Sword of Protection's many intended functions is to heal and restore balance.
1,11,1,Adora,Okay. Is there someone else I can talk to?
1,11,1,Other,Query not recognized.
1,11,1,Adora,Okay. Has visions from when she first found the sword] Let me talk to Light Hope.
1,11,1,Other,Light Hope.
1,11,1,Adora,Light Hope. That's her name isn't it? The woman I saw when I touched the sword for the first time? Where is she?
1,11,1,Other,"Yes, Light Hope is here. She has been waiting for you."
1,11,1,Adora,Can I talk to her?
1,11,1,Other,"You will meet her soon enough. But first, you must let go."
1,11,1,Adora,What's that supposed to mean?
1,11,1,Other,You are not ready yet. You must let go.
1,11,1,Adora,Let go of what?
1,11,1,Catra,Hey! Watch it!
1,11,1,Adora,Catra? What are you doing here?
1,11,1,Other,Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.
1,11,1,Adora,"No, no, no, not again!"
1,11,1,Catra,What just happened?
1,11,1,Adora,This isn't good. You're not supposed to be in here.
1,11,1,Catra,What are those?
1,11,1,Adora,Also not good!
1,11,1,Adora,Come on! We need to run!
1,11,1,Catra,What's going on? Why are those things trying to kill us?
1,11,1,Adora,They're trying to kill you. This place sees you as an invader.
1,11,1,Catra,"Well, can't you tell them to stop?"
1,11,1,Adora,"No, I can't tell them to stop! Clearly nothing in here is listening to me!"
1,11,1,Catra,--Adora?
1,11,1,Adora,Stand back!
1,11,1,Catra,What are you doing?!
1,11,2,Adora,"You shouldn't be here, Catra. Those things aren't going to stop until they get you, and as long as I'm protecting you, they'll see me as a threat, too."
1,11,2,Catra,"Uh, good thing I didn't ask you to protect me."
1,11,2,Adora,"Wait, you know, what-- Okay. Why are you here, anyway? I mean, how did you even find this place?"
1,11,2,Catra,It sent up a beam of light a mile high. It wasn't hard.
1,11,2,Adora,...Does Shadow Weaver know you're here?
1,11,2,Catra,"I'd say Shadow Weaver's got bigger problems right now. Why are you looking at me like that? Wait. Nooo... I know what this is about. Ugh, I knew you'd be weird about me letting you escape. I told you it's not because I like you."
1,11,2,Adora,"I mean, I didn't--I didn't say anything."
1,11,2,Catra,"Anyway, what are you doing here? Where are your new best friends? I thought you guys did everything together."
1,11,2,Adora,"Oh, my friends? You mean the ones you kidnapped and held for ransom? The ones you let Shadow Weaver imprison and curse?"
1,11,2,Catra,"Yeah, obviously. What other friends would I be talking about?"
1,11,2,Adora,"...Come on. Those things will be back any minute, we need to get out of here."
1,11,2,Catra,"Well, we don't need to go together. You do your weird little magic quest thing, I'll find my own way out."
1,11,3,Catra,Another dead end.
1,11,3,Adora,"No, it's not. Eternia. Eh, long story."
1,11,3,Catra,"Cool, you found the Infinite Darkness room. Have fun, I'm gonna find another way around. ...Uh...where'd the door go?"
1,11,3,Adora,"Wait, I think I see something. Hello? Light Hope?"
1,11,3,Catra,What's--
1,11,3,Adora,What kind of game are you playing?!
1,11,3,Catra,"Whoa, whoa! I have no idea what's going on. There's no way we can actually be in the Fright Zone!"
1,11,3,Adora,"So what is this, another Shadow Weaver mind trick?!"
1,11,3,Catra,I doubt it. Now let----go of me!
1,11,3,Catra,"Hey, you! Guard. ...Uh, hello? Hey, Adora! This isn't real! ...Adora? Adora?!"
1,11,3,Adora,Catra?
1,11,3,Catra,Adora!
1,11,3,Catra,"Hey, Adora? There's a--"
1,11,3,Adora,Shh.
1,11,3,Catra,Does it look broken to you?!
1,11,3,Adora,"It's not broken, you're fine!"
1,11,3,Catra,I'm bleeding!
1,11,3,Adora,You're not bleeding! And why would you try and pick a fight with Octavia anyway?
1,11,3,Catra,"I didn't do anything, all I did was exist near her. ...And scratch her on the eyeball. And call her a dumbface."
1,11,3,Adora,Catra--
1,11,3,Catra,What?! She has a dumb face!
1,11,3,Adora,Where is she?
1,11,3,Adora,"Hey, Octavia!"
1,11,3,Adora,You're a dumbface!
1,11,3,Catra,She's coming!
1,11,3,Adora,Run!
1,11,5,Catra,What was that?!
1,11,5,Adora,"It must have been some kind of simulation. It's tapping into our memories. Why, I have no idea..."
1,11,5,Catra,"Ugh, this place is so weird. How can you deal with all of this magic stuff?"
1,11,5,Adora,I'm only dealing with it because I need to figure out how to heal Glimmer after someone got her cursed.
1,11,5,Catra,What do you want? An apology? You're not getting one.
1,11,5,Adora,...Can I ask you something?
1,11,5,Catra,Can I stop you?
1,11,5,Adora,...Why did you help me escape after Shadow Weaver captured us?
1,11,5,Catra,Not this again.
1,11,5,Adora,"It's the one thing I can't figure out. You didn't have to do that. You could've gotten caught...why risk it? Whoa, whoa, whoa--!"
1,11,5,Catra,Did you really think I'd just let Shadow Weaver erase your memory like that?
1,11,5,Adora,I dunno. Probably.
1,11,5,Catra,"Yeah, well, you never did have too much faith in me."
1,11,5,Adora,Can you blame me?
1,11,5,Catra,Not really.
1,11,5,Catra,"It wasn't all bad growing up in the Fright Zone, was it? I mean, you still have some good memories, right?"
1,11,5,Adora,"Of course I do. But it doesn't change the fact that the Horde is evil. I had no choice. I couldn't go back. ...Hey. I miss you, too."
1,11,5,Catra,Wha--? I don't miss you. Get over yourself!
1,11,5,Adora,Not until you admit you like me!
1,11,5,Catra,I don't like you!
1,11,5,Catra,"Oh, come on!"
1,11,6,Catra,Oww!
1,11,6,Adora,You okay?
1,11,6,Other,And there's our winner.
1,11,6,Other,"Good work, cadet. I like your focus. This win will definitely be reported back to Lord Hordak."
1,11,6,Catra,What was that? Way to gang up on me!
1,11,6,Other,You were fighting dirty. I was just leveling the field.
1,11,6,Adora,"Hey, you were awesome! Did I hurt you?"
1,11,6,Catra,"No, I'm fine. You're just lucky I let you win."
1,11,6,Adora,Right...
1,11,6,Catra,"I'm serious! If I came in first, people might expect me to actually start doing stuff around here. Trust me, second place suits me just fine."
1,11,6,Adora,"Yeah, okay. Come on, let's go cool down."
1,11,6,Catra,"In a minute, I'll meet you there."
1,11,6,Adora,"Hey, guys, wait up!"
1,11,7,Other,Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.
1,11,7,Adora,Catra? Catra!
1,11,7,Catra,Adora!
1,11,7,Adora,Catra!
1,11,7,Catra,Adora!
1,11,7,Adora,Are you okay?
1,11,7,Catra,I had it.
1,11,7,Adora,"Sure you did, we need to make sure we stay together from now on."
1,11,7,Catra,Will you stop telling me what to do?!
1,11,7,Catra,I'm sick of this stupid place. Let's just get out of here.
1,11,8,Adora,What is your problem? I was just trying to save you.
1,11,8,Catra,"For the last time, I don't need you to save me. I've been doing just fine on my own. No thanks to you."
1,11,8,Adora,"Catra, wait. ...I'm sorry for leaving. I couldn't go back to the Fright Zone, not after I saw what the Horde was really doing. I never wanted to leave you. ...You could come with me! You-you-you could join the rebellion! I know you're not a bad person, Catra. You don't belong with the Horde."
1,11,8,Catra,Let's just get this over with.
1,11,9,Adora,"Catra, wait up!"
1,11,9,Catra,What's it like being the world's slowest person?
1,11,9,Adora,Whoa.
1,11,9,Catra,It's open.
1,11,9,Adora,We're definitely not allowed in there.
1,11,9,Adora,You don't have to go in there.
1,11,9,Catra,Wow...
1,11,9,Adora,Ma-maybe we should get out of here.
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,Get out!
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,Catra... ...you stay.
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,What do you think you're doing in here?
1,11,9,Catra,We were just playing.
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,Insolent child. I've come to expect such disgraceful behavior from you. But I will not allow you to drag Adora down as well.
1,11,9,Adora,"Shadow Weaver, it wasn't her fault, it was my idea, too!"
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,"You have never been anything more than a nuisance to me! I've kept you around this long because Adora was fond of you, but if you ever do anything to jeopardize her future, I will dispose of you myself. Do you understand?"
1,11,9,Adora,Please stop!
1,11,9,Adora,She didn't mean to!
1,11,9,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, you must do a better job of keeping her under control. Do not let something like this happen again."
1,11,10,Catra,"You always need to play the hero, don't you?"
1,11,10,Adora,I was only trying to protect you.
1,11,10,Catra,You never protected me! Not in any way that would put you on Shadow Weaver's bad side.
1,11,11,Catra,Admit it. You love being her favorite!
1,11,11,Adora,That's not true!
1,11,11,Catra,"Oh, yeah? When you left, who do you think took the fall for you? Who was protecting me then?"
1,11,11,Adora,You don't have to let Shadow Weaver treat you like that anymore. You can leave----just like I did!
1,11,11,Catra,"Oh, because I need to follow you everywhere you go?!"
1,11,11,Adora,I didn't mean it that way.
1,11,11,Catra,"I don't. Want. To leave. What don't you understand about that? I'm not afraid of Shadow Weaver anymore, and I'm a better Force Captain than you would've ever been."
1,11,11,Adora,You always said you didn't care about things like that...
1,11,11,Catra,"Well, I was lying, obviously!"
1,11,11,Adora,"Catra, just wait!"
1,11,11,Catra,"Why do you think I gave the sword back to you in the Fright Zone? I didn't want you to come back, Adora!"
1,11,11,Adora,For the honor of-- Huh?
1,11,12,Other,You were fighting dirty.
1,11,12,Shadow Weaver,Insolent child.
1,11,12,Adora,"I'm sorry, Catra--"
1,11,12,Catra,Let. Me. OUT OF HERE!
1,11,12,Adora,...Catra?
1,11,12,Adora,"Catra, it's okay, it's just me. It doesn't matter what they do to us, you know? You look out for me, and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other."
1,11,12,Catra,You promise?
1,11,12,Catra,You promise?
1,11,12,Adora,I promise.
1,11,12,Adora,"...Come on, let's go back out."
1,11,13,Adora,"Stop it, I'm not your enemy. Light Hope... Just let me talk to Light Hope!"
1,11,13,Adora,Catra?
1,11,13,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
1,11,13,Adora,"Catra, help me, please..."
1,11,13,Catra,"This thing wouldn't work for me if I tried, would it? It only works for you. Then again, you're special. That's what Shadow Weaver always said."
1,11,13,Adora,Catra...what are you doing?
1,11,13,Catra,"Ah, you know? It all makes sense now. You've always been the one holding me back. You wanted me to think I needed you. You wanted me to feel weak. Every hero needs a sidekick, right?"
1,11,13,Adora,"Catra, no, that's not how it was..."
1,11,13,Catra,"The sad thing is, I've spent all this time hoping you'd come back to the Horde, when really you leaving was the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so much stronger than anyone ever thought."
1,11,13,Catra,I wonder what I could've been if I'd gotten rid of you sooner...
1,11,13,Adora,I-I'm sorry! I never meant to make you feel like you were second best! Please don't do this!
1,11,13,Catra,"Bye, Adora. I really am going to miss you."
1,11,13,Adora,"Catra! Catra, no!"
1,11,13,Light Hope,Adora.
1,11,13,Light Hope,You must. Let. Go.
1,11,14,Scorpia,"And then there's the day, Catra and I were on a boat together! Did I ever tell you about that?"
1,11,14,Entrapta,I'm pretty sure you did.
1,11,14,Other,"Oh, and one time, Catra and I, were on a boat together! That was the best day ever."
1,11,14,Entrapta,"Yep, you did."
1,11,14,Scorpia,"I think that's really when we made our connection, you know? You ever meet someone and you just instantly click?"
1,11,14,Entrapta,"Yes, it was like that with Emily."
1,11,14,Scorpia,What happened to you? You're filthy! Are you okay? Do you need first aid? Do you need to be nursed tenderly back to health?!
1,11,14,Catra,"Scorpia, remember that talk we had about personal space?"
1,11,14,Scorpia,"Oh, right. Ten-foot radius."
1,11,14,Entrapta,How'd it go? Did you find it?
1,11,14,Catra,"Uh, why is the princess loose?"
1,11,14,Entrapta,"Ohhh, right. Seriously, though, did you find it?"
1,11,14,Entrapta,An intact data crystal? I have never seen one so perfectly preserved. This could be a game-changer. Who knows what secrets it could contain?
1,11,14,Scorpia,"Oh, man, I knew Catra could do it. It's like I was telling you, she is the best friend ever."
1,11,14,Catra,...Just keep it down. I'm going to bed.
1,12,0,Light Hope,"Hello, Adora."
1,12,0,Shadow Weaver,Adora...
1,12,0,Catra,Every hero needs a sidekick...right?
1,12,0,Adora,For the honor...of Grayskull!
1,12,0,Entrapta,I just need a little more time!
1,12,1,Light Hope,"Hello, Adora. You've come at last."
1,12,1,Adora,"Light Hope... I can't believe I'm really seeing you. I mean, I've seen you in my brain, I think. But this is real! Is this real? Wait, am I dead? I fell...I'm sorry, I'm freaking out. I'm Adora."
1,12,1,Light Hope,"Yes, I know. I have been waiting for you since you were an infant, but I could not reach you. And I could not protect you from the Horde. I watched you grow up from afar."
1,12,1,Adora,"Wow, that's--that's kind of creepy, honestly."
1,12,1,Light Hope,"Creepy? Yes. I have been called this before. I chose this form so as not to alarm you, but if it does not suit you, I will choose another."
1,12,1,Light Hope,Is this better?
1,12,1,Adora,"Oh, no. That's--that's, um, that's definitely way worse."
1,12,1,Light Hope,Forgive me. My human protocol is many years out of date. Allow me to select a new form that you will find appealing.
1,12,1,Adora,"Ooh, no, no, that's, thank you! No, that's enough, tha--no, that's--that's, that's t-totally okay, please stop!"
1,12,2,Glimmer,But shouldn't she be back by now? She said she was gonna get training to fix me! How long is that going to take-- OW! And what kind of monster puts a chair here?!
1,12,2,Bow,"Okay, I'm worried, too, Glimmer, but taking it out on the furniture isn't going to help."
1,12,2,Glimmer,We can't sit here and hope that she comes back eventually. We have to do something.
1,12,2,Bow,Like what?
1,12,2,Other,"Princess? There's, uh, something here to see you."
1,12,2,Glimmer,Don't you mean someone?
1,12,2,Other,No. I mean something.
1,12,2,Bow,Our horse!
1,12,2,Swift Wind,I am my own horse. Call me Swift Wind!
1,12,2,Bow,Our horse can talk!
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"Yeah, yeah, I can speak my mind now, pretty crazy--SO, I was thinking--"
1,12,2,Bow,He's a talking hoOoOoOrse!
1,12,2,Swift Wind,As we've established. Now--
1,12,2,Glimmer,He has wings!
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"Okay, I'll give you a moment to freak out, and then we need to talk."
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"--Great! I think Adora needs our help. Since Adora transformed me, I've been able to feel where she is at all times. It's like instinct. But now I feel a pull, as if I'm being summoned to her side."
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"As part of Adora's herd, I need your help. Will you come?"
1,12,2,Glimmer,Of course. Lead the way.
1,12,2,Bow,"But, Glimmer, your glitching."
1,12,2,Glimmer,Is what got us into this. Adora left to save me. Now it's time for us to save her. You in?
1,12,2,Bow,Always. But...I don't think your mom is going to like us leaving so soon after our last mission.
1,12,2,Glimmer,She doesn't need to know. We'll sneak out and be back before my mom even realizes we're gone.
1,12,2,Glimmer,Mom!
1,12,2,Glimmer,What are you doing here?
1,12,2,Angella,Coming to see why my guard was escorting a horse into your room.
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"I like to think of myself more as a role model for all horse kind. ...I mean, uh, what talking horse? What's happening?"
1,12,2,Angella,You should get going if you want to track down Adora.
1,12,2,Glimmer,You're not gonna stop us?
1,12,2,Angella,"Glimmer. I told you I regretted giving up after your father died. I will not consign you to the same regrets. Commander Glimmer. I order you to continue your mission to find Adora, and bring her back home."
1,12,2,Glimmer,"Right away, Your Majesty. ...Come on!"
1,12,2,Swift Wind,"Uh, when we're back, I'd like to talk about freeing all the horses in your stables. I think that's seriously--"
1,12,2,Bow,Later!
1,12,2,Swift Wind,Hey! Hey! I'm still talking to the queen!
1,12,2,Angella,Please be careful.
1,12,3,Catra,"Okay, I--what is going on here?"
1,12,3,Entrapta,Catra! You got my note.
1,12,3,Catra,"The one you dropped on my head from the air vent that says, 'Come to my lab'?"
1,12,3,Entrapta,"Yes, that's the one. I've made great strides in analyzing the data from the First Ones data crystal you brought me... Look!"
1,12,3,Catra,Where did all of this come from?
1,12,3,Entrapta,"Oh, you know. Here and there...rooms..."
1,12,3,Catra,Were there people in these rooms?
1,12,3,Entrapta,"Well, not when I went back to take the stuff."
1,12,3,Catra,You definitely belong here with us.
1,12,3,Entrapta,...So! The data!
1,12,3,Scorpia,Ha! Wow! Whoa.
1,12,3,Entrapta,"Look at these readings. It's incredible, this seems to confirm my theories about the techno-organic nature of First Ones machinery resulting in thaumaturlogical compatibility between magic and science!"
1,12,3,Catra,"I'm going to need you to try again, but this time, talk like a normal person."
1,12,3,Entrapta,Scorpia seems like she understands.
1,12,3,Catra,Scorpia is drawing stick figures holding hands.
1,12,3,Scorpia,"I call it 'Super Pal Trio'! This is me, this is Catra, and I think it's clear, come on. I mean, I'm a bit of an artist."
1,12,3,Entrapta,"I looked at the rock, which is a crys-tal, and used math...wait, do I have to explain math to you?"
1,12,3,Catra,"Yes or no, did the crystal give you enough data to upgrade our weapons?"
1,12,3,Entrapta,"Weapons? HA! This is so much bigger than weapons. This could change everything. Etheria's not just a planet. Whatever the First Ones did to it, it went deep."
1,12,3,Catra,And what does that mean?
1,12,3,Entrapta,"You're asking me about my theories? I've waited years for someone to ask me about my theories! Hang on, I made a model!"
1,12,4,Adora,"I don't want to be rude, but, um...who are you?"
1,12,4,Light Hope,"I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator. I was created by the First Ones, as you call them."
1,12,4,Adora,"Okay, quick follow-up...who are the First Ones?"
1,12,4,Light Hope,The First Ones were explorers who journeyed from beyond the stars to settle Etheria. They built this place for you...the Crystal Castle.
1,12,4,Light Hope,"Adora, I've waited so long for you, and now the time has come to show you your destiny."
1,12,4,Adora,"Great, because I actually had a quest--"
1,12,4,Light Hope,"You are She-Ra, Etheria's champion, appointed by the First Ones to protect and unite our planet. There have been many before you, but the line was broken. You are the first She-Ra in a thousand years."
1,12,5,Entrapta,"Behold! Etheria. The First Ones didn't just settle on the surface of Etheria, their technology runs throughout the planet's core. This whole planet it's--it's all First Ones' tech."
1,12,6,Light Hope,"Everything on Etheria is connected. The princesses are granted power over the elements through their Runestones. As She-Ra, it is your duty to bring the princesses together. Only then can balance be restored to Etheria."
1,12,6,Adora,"That sounds great, but the things is--"
1,12,6,Light Hope,You are correct. It is great.
1,12,7,Catra,And what are these supposed to be?
1,12,7,Entrapta,"Runestones. From the data I've managed to extract, they regulate the planet through the princesses. They're directly connected to each other and to the planet's power grid in a delicate balance."
1,12,7,Catra,Which means?
1,12,7,Entrapta,Which means they're our best access point to hack the planet.
1,12,8,Light Hope,"When the princesses and their elements are in balance, Etheria functions as it should. But the Horde is destroying us in their quest for power. There is no predicting what they will do next."
1,12,9,Catra,Hack the planet?
1,12,9,Entrapta,"Hypothetically, but it's not so simple. There's only a handful of Runestones in the whole world."
1,12,9,Scorpia,Runestone? You mean like the Black Garnet? 'Cause we have the Black Garnet.
1,12,9,Entrapta,The Black Garnet? You have a Runestone? The Fright Zone has a Runestone?
1,12,9,Scorpia,"Uh, duh. It was my family's. But when the Horde landed, we gave it to Hordak, who then gave it to Shadow Weaver, who--you know, you tell a friend, he tells a friend, it's like, it's kind of one of those things."
1,12,9,Entrapta,"Where is it?! Can I see it, can I touch it?!"
1,12,9,Catra,"Okay, calm down. What exactly are you planning on doing to the Black Garnet?"
1,12,9,Entrapta,"If we hack the Runestone grid, we could boost the Garnet's power and use it for...well, anything. As a power source, as--"
1,12,9,Catra,A weapon?
1,12,9,Entrapta,"Potentially! But if it's like my other experiments, the results will be explosive."
1,12,9,Scorpia,I don't think Shadow Weaver will like that.
1,12,9,Catra,"Scorpia's right. Shadow Weaver won't like it. ...So, I will absolutely get you the Black Garnet. Leave it all to me."
1,12,9,Hordak,"What do you have for me, little spy?"
1,12,9,Other,: Catra! I've made great strides in analyzing the data from the First Ones data crystal you brought me... Look!
1,12,10,Adora,"This is all super good information, um, and I can't wait to hear more just one thing, though--"
1,12,10,Light Hope,"Is there something you do not understand? I can start again from the beginning, if you would like. I am Light Hope, Etheria's facilitator--"
1,12,10,Adora,"No, no, I got it."
1,12,10,Light Hope,Have I mentioned that you are chosen?
1,12,10,Adora,Can we skip to the part about my powers? I need to learn how to heal my friend.
1,12,10,Light Hope,Your...friend?
1,12,10,Adora,Yes. Shadow Weaver did something to Glimmer and took her powers away. I need to figure out how to heal her.
1,12,10,Light Hope,Her connection with her Runestone was disrupted.
1,12,10,Adora,Can I fix it?
1,12,10,Light Hope,You will be able to do many incredible things...with training.
1,12,10,Adora,"Great. So, uh, how long will this training take--like a day, or--"
1,12,10,Light Hope,Years.
1,12,10,Adora,"Years?! Glimmer doesn't have years. She's hurt because of me, I messed up. I got Glimmer and Bow captured, and Entrapta--it's my fault! ...I have to fix it."
1,12,10,Light Hope,"Yes, your mission is to fix the planet."
1,12,10,Adora,My mission is to help my friends. That's why I came here.
1,12,10,Light Hope,You are She-Ra. Your purpose is to protect all of Etheria. You cannot help only your friends.
1,12,10,Adora,Why can't I do both?
1,12,10,Light Hope,"Adora, you do not yet realize the power you have. You are distracted by your attachments. There was one before you who could not let go. Her name was Mara."
1,12,10,Adora,Mara? Madame Razz's Mara? What happened to her?
1,12,10,Light Hope,Mara was the last She-Ra before you. She struggled with a power that she could not control. Until it became too much for her mind.
1,12,10,Adora,...She snapped?
1,12,10,Light Hope,She was compromised. She gave in to fear and faulty reasoning. Her desperate actions led to devastation. Mara stranded us in the empty dimension of Despandos. She broke the She-Ra line. She nearly destroyed us.
1,12,10,Light Hope,...Adora. I have waited here for a thousand years alone. I did not know if I would ever see another She-Ra. You must stay here and train. Learn to be the She-Ra that Mara could not be.
1,12,10,Adora,"I will. I will do whatever you want. I'll come back, and train, and learn about everything. But I have to heal Glimmer first. I can save the planet and save her."
1,12,10,Catra,Adora?
1,12,10,Entrapta,I just need a little more time--I just need a little more time!
1,12,10,Light Hope,"You feel guilt at these memories. It is as you said, your friends are endangered by your presence. It is better to let go now."
1,12,10,Adora,But...I can't just leave my friends...
1,12,11,Catra,"Alright, hurry it up, those machines aren't going to hook up themselves."
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,They won't be hooked up at all.
1,12,11,Scorpia,"Shadow Weaver! Uh----We just, uh--"
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,"Silence! Did you really think you could invade my inner sanctum without me noticing? I never thought you were so bold as to openly rebel, but it will be my pleasure to put you back in your place!"
1,12,11,Catra,"Oh, Shadow Weaver. I can do whatever I want with this hunk of rock."
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,"Absurd, by whose authority?"
1,12,11,Hordak,By mine.
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,Lord Hordak! I don't understand.
1,12,11,Hordak,"Catra and Entrapta have been working on a way to meld this strange First Ones tech with our machines to weaponize it. I found out......and was intrigued. I gave Force Captain Catra and her team my blessing to go ahead. ...So, understand, Shadow Weaver. I am displeased with your interruption."
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,"My Lord, you're really going to let this--this princess tinker with my Runestone?!"
1,12,11,Hordak,"Her tinkering has increased the firepower of every weapon she's touched. So yes, she gets to tinker with whatever she wants. Including the Black Garnet, which is mine to give or take, as I see fit."
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,"You can't... You can't do this! I alone have learned how to draw power from it, a feat no sorceress has done before! I have unlocked its potential!"
1,12,11,Hordak,"And you wasted it on parlor tricks. Force Captain Catra, proceed. The Garnet is yours."
1,12,11,Catra,"Yes, Lord Hordak."
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,NO!
1,12,11,Catra,Stop her! Don't let her touch the--
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,You will not take what is mine!
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,"That's right, run away. It's the only thing you've ever been good at! You have always been a disappointment. You've learned nothing from me!"
1,12,11,Catra,"Oh, no. I've learned everything from you. How to predict when you'll strike, how to dodge, how to resist. You thought you were punishing me all these years? Wrong. You were training me for this day!"
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,NO!
1,12,11,Shadow Weaver,Come back...Come back to me! Come back to me!
1,12,11,Catra,"Scorpia, restrain the sorceress. We won't have to worry about her any longer. Entrapta, if you would."
1,12,11,Entrapta,"Alright, everyone. Let's get weird."
1,12,11,Scorpia,Look!
1,12,12,Swift Wind,"And then I realized I'm free, but the other horses aren't. So I named myself Swift Wind after the swift winds of revolution and left to go kick down stable doors. Freedom, equality, and hay for all!"
1,12,12,Glimmer,Do you guys hear that?
1,12,12,Bow,Get behind me!
1,12,12,Glimmer,What was that about?
1,12,12,Swift Wind,"I feel something. We should run. ...No. We have to get Adora. Adora, then run."
1,12,12,Bow,"Swift Wind, what is it?"
1,12,12,Swift Wind,A bad thing. Hurry.
1,12,13,Entrapta,Amazing! The Garnet is siphoning energy at a near exponential rate. Yet the output is still building...!
1,12,13,Catra,What does that mean?
1,12,13,Entrapta,It means things are getting interesting.
1,12,14,Bow,"Is it just me, or is it really cold?"
1,12,14,Glimmer,It's...snowing?
1,12,14,Bow,That's impossible. It never snows in the Whispering Woods.
1,12,14,Glimmer,What's happening?!
1,12,14,Swift Wind,The bad thing!
1,12,14,Bow,"We can't stay here! Swift Wind, do you sense Adora?"
1,12,14,Swift Wind,There! She's over there!
1,12,14,Glimmer,This would be a great time for my powers to come back!
1,12,14,Swift Wind,"Wait...wait! I know this. Hang on, I think I can--"
1,12,14,Bow,What is that?!
1,12,14,Swift Wind,Uh...this way!
1,12,14,Glimmer,Adora!
1,12,14,Bow,Adora! We're here! Wake up!
1,12,14,Swift Wind,I think I can reach her. Hold on.
1,12,14,Glimmer,Swift Wind?
1,12,14,Bow,Uh...Glimmer?
1,12,15,Light Hope,The Horde is hurting us. Balance Etheria.
1,12,15,Adora,"Light Hope? Light Hope, come back! I don't--I don't know what to do."
1,12,15,Swift Wind,Adoraa... Adora!
1,12,15,Adora,Our horse?
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"Once again, I'm no one's horse. I'm Swift Wind."
1,12,15,Adora,You can talk?
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"Yes, I can talk."
1,12,15,Adora,You can talk?
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"I can see now why you're friends with Bow and Glimmer. They need your help, which is why I'm here. So....which way's the exit?"
1,12,15,Adora,I don't know. Light Hope disappeared and I-I don't know if I should go back.
1,12,15,Swift Wind,What do you mean?
1,12,15,Adora,"Light Hope said if I leave here, I'll make things worse. She's right. Everyone will be better off if I just stay far away from them. It's-It's for the greater good."
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"Well, that's just stupid."
1,12,15,Adora,"What? No, it's not."
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"Adora, I've had the ability to form complex thought for like...a week, and even I know you can't help anyone by hiding. Where would all the horses I freed from their barns be if I just sat in a pasture and moped?"
1,12,15,Adora,I am not moping...
1,12,15,Adora,"I'm not! I hurt people, I ruined my friends' lives!"
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"If that's true, then why are Bow and Glimmer here trying to rescue you?"
1,12,15,Swift Wind,"Bow and Glimmer are risking their lives. Not because you're She-Ra, but because you're their friend. What good is all your power if you don't use it to help the people that you love?"
1,12,15,Adora,"...I'm not Mara. I'm not the She-Ras of the past. I didn't do this to fulfill some destiny. I became She-Ra to help others. My attachments, my friends, are a part of who I am."
1,12,15,Swift Wind,So. Are you staying? Or going?
1,12,15,Adora,Let's go.
1,12,16,Glimmer,Adora! You're back!
1,12,16,Bow,Adora! Spiders!
1,12,16,Adora,For the honor...of Grayskull!
1,12,16,Adora,"Now, Swifty!"
1,12,16,Swift Wind,Hold on!
1,12,16,Bow,"Guys, look!"
1,12,16,Glimmer,It's not just the woods...it's...
1,12,16,Adora,It's the entire world.
1,12,16,Glimmer,"Bright Moon. Swift Wind, hurry!"
1,12,17,Scorpia,Wow... What do you think it's doing?
1,12,17,Catra,I don't know. But I can work with this.
1,13,0,Adora,"It's coming from the Fright Zone! Whatever's happening, the Horde is causing it!"
1,13,0,Bow,The Whispering Woods are freezing over! What'll we do?
1,13,0,Glimmer,We have to get home! We have to make sure everyone at Bright Moon is okay.
1,13,0,Scorpia,Catra! You've gotta see this!
1,13,0,Scorpia,"Tidal waves, Fire Storms, Earthquakes.. maaaan, Etheria's really taking this hard. I mean-- Yay for us but also woe."
1,13,0,Entrapta,"The experiment has been more effective than I could ever have dreamed, this proves my hypothesis correct! With the Black Garnet functioning at two hundred percent power the precarious equilibrium that governs all of Etheria's natural functions has been thrown into complete chaos! No doubt as a result of the other elemental runestones-- ey!"
1,13,0,Catra,Translate.
1,13,0,Entrapta,"By making the Black Garnet more powerful, we've sapped power from the other princesses Runestones, upsetting the balance and making the weather go screwy. It's all in my notes if you'd like to--"
1,13,0,Catra,Woa woa woa woa wait! What was that you just said about making the other princesses less powerful?
1,13,0,Entrapta,"Well the Elemental princesses, that is. You don't have to worry about me and Scorpia. I don't have a runestone and Scorpia doesn't appear to have any connection to the Black Garnet anymore-- if she ever did."
1,13,0,Scorpia,Huh? Somebody say my name?
1,13,0,Catra,And how would we make an effect like that... Permanent?
1,13,0,Entrapta,"Well, I'd have to run more tests to know for sure but--"
1,13,0,Entrapta,"Or yeah, that should work too."
1,13,0,Catra,"Get a strike team together, we're going to Bright Moon."
1,13,0,Scorpia,Bright Moon? Why?
1,13,0,Catra,"Because, we're going to take out Bright Moon's Runestone, and with the Whispering Woods frozen over... there's nothing stopping us."
1,13,1,Bow,Look!
1,13,1,Glimmer,That's Bright Moon! It's the distress beacon.
1,13,1,Swift Wind,Hang on!
1,13,1,Glimmer,Mom! What's going on?
1,13,1,Angella,The elements are out of harmony. The Moonstone is using all its power to counteract the growing cloud of darkness.... but it's not enough. It's taking nearly all my strength just to keep my connection with it.
1,13,1,Adora,That cloud is coming from the Fright Zone
1,13,1,Bow,So what's our plan? We do have a plan.. right? Guys?
1,13,1,Adora,The woods are frozen over. There's nothing left to shield Bright Moon from the Horde. We have to prepare for an attack.
1,13,1,Bow,"our scouts have reported sighting the entire Horde Army in the woods, moving towards us at top speed."
1,13,1,Angella,"We must protect Bright Moon at all costs. If the moonstone is destroyed, there will be nothing left to stop the darkness."
1,13,1,Bow,"Someone must've seen the distress beacon by now, why hasn't anyone come?"
1,13,1,Adora,The Alliance is broken and other princesses have their own kingdoms to protect. No one's coming Bow.
1,13,1,Other,Someone's come!
1,13,1,Bow,Is it the princesses?
1,13,1,Bow,"Oh. Spinnerella and Netossa ha ha, thanks for coming guys..."
1,13,1,Netossa,"You still don't know what we do, do you?"
1,13,1,Bow,Aaaah.. no.
1,13,1,Netossa,"Seriously?! It's in the name, NET- Tossa. NETS, I toss NETS! Okay?"
1,13,1,Other,"Yes darling, you have beautiful nets."
1,13,1,Glimmer,"At least you have powers, which is more than I've got. But it doesn't matter. I don't need magic to fight!"
1,13,1,Angella,"Glimmer, not only are you without your powers but you're still glitching, it's too dangerous."
1,13,1,Glimmer,But mom!
1,13,1,Adora,"Your mom is right Glimmer, I don't want any of you risking yourselves. She-Ra can do this alone. This is what she's for."
1,13,1,Bow,"Adora, not even She-Ra can take on an army of Horde soldiers ALL on her own."
1,13,1,Adora,Than what good is she?
1,13,1,Glimmer,Adora... are you okay?
1,13,1,Adora,Catra will be leading the Horde when they attack. I have to face her. I can't let her hurt anyone else.
1,13,1,Glimmer,What happened to you in that first one's temple?
1,13,1,Adora,"I saw Catra in there. I thought I could get through to her, but all I did was push her farther to the side of evil. Light Hope said that I'd endanger my friends by coming back and she was right. Everything that's happening now is my fault..."
1,13,1,Glimmer,You've got this. And we've got your back.
1,13,1,Glimmer,"Now come on, the Horde will be here soon. We have to be ready."
1,13,1,Glimmer,Welcome to the Bright Moon armory! Well it's not really but I've been sneaking weapons and stashing them in here for months!
1,13,1,Bow,Dibs on arrows!
1,13,1,Adora,Aaaaah... no.
1,13,1,Angella,Glimmer.
1,13,1,Glimmer,Ah ma mom! How'd you know we'd be in here?
1,13,1,Angella,Did you really think I wouldn't notice you were hoarding weapons?
1,13,1,Glimmer,I'm sorry mom. I can't just stand by while my friends and my home are in danger. I have to do this.
1,13,1,Angella,I know.
1,13,1,Glimmer,"Mom I... wait, what?"
1,13,1,Angella,"I've been trying all these years to mold you into someone more like me... but you're too stubborn and hotheaded, and brave.. like your father. This was your father's staff, I think it's time you had it."
1,13,1,Adora,They're here. For the honor of Grayskull!
1,13,1,Bow,We got this. Right?
1,13,1,Adora,Yeah.... Definitely.
1,13,1,Glimmer,They're going to be sorry they ever tried to mess with Bright Moon.
1,13,1,Adora,Defend the Castle.
1,13,1,Glimmer,Adora! She-Ra needs our help.
1,13,1,Angella,Go to her. I'll keep the Moonstone lit in the darkness away from the battlefield as long as I can.
1,13,1,Swift Wind,You heard the Queen For the rebellion!
1,13,1,Catra,Hey Adora.
1,13,1,Adora,Catra Surprised to see me?
1,13,1,Catra,"Not really, I figured it wouldn't be that easy to get rid of you."
1,13,1,Catra,"You know, I'm actually glad you did make it out of there alive.... because now.. I can take you out myself."
1,13,1,Scorpia,Well isn't that nice? You've accessorized! Not that it's going to help you!
1,13,1,Netossa,Boom! Nets!
1,13,1,Catra,Tired already? I thought punching was supposed to be like-- the one thing you're good at.
1,13,1,Adora,And I thought you were supposed to be quicker.
1,13,1,Adora,"Give it up Catra, there's no way you win this."
1,13,1,Catra,I already made it a lot further than anyone thought I would.
1,13,1,Catra,"You on the other hand, you're not looking so good."
1,13,1,Adora,This isn't over!
1,13,1,Catra,OF COURSE it's not over!
1,13,1,Catra,It won't be over until Bright Moon is destroyed and the rebellion falls. It won't be OVER until darkness covers Etheria forever. And it won't be over until I see the looks on your friends' faces when they find out you failed. That you were too WEAK to save them!
1,13,1,Adora,Enough! You've lost Catra.
1,13,1,Catra,You sure about that?
1,13,1,Catra,What? Did you really think this was about you?
1,13,1,Catra,That Runestone is your last defense.... isn't it? HAHAHAHA! Have fun!
1,13,1,Glimmer,NO!
1,13,1,Scorpia,"So where were we? Oh yeah, I  was about to punch you!"
1,13,1,Adora,Where's my shield? {She searches the water]
1,13,1,Bow,uuh ohh.
1,13,1,Scorpia,"Huu, pretty!"
1,13,1,Catra,"Now, it's over."
1,13,1,Swift Wind,Come on!
1,13,1,Glimmer,Oh mom!
1,13,1,Swift Wind,Princess!
1,13,1,Bow,Adora? Adora!
1,13,1,Bow,"Come on, Don't give up yet. Please! We can still fix this, right? Please tell me we can fix this."
1,13,1,Adora,"ah.. I.. I am sorry,"
1,13,1,Bow,"it's okay,"
1,13,1,Sea Hawk,ADVENTURE!
1,13,1,Mermista,Don't do that.
1,13,1,Sea Hawk,Sorry.
1,13,1,Adora,Mermista! Sea Hawk! You Came!
1,13,1,Mermista,"Yeah- sorry it took so long, the sea kiiiinda sucked today."
1,13,1,Catra,"Come on, GET UP!"
1,13,1,Perfuma,I saw the distress beacon are you all okay?
1,13,1,Adora,No!
1,13,1,Frosta,I hope I'm not too late.
1,13,1,Adora,No! You're right on time!
1,13,1,Adora,FOR ETHERIA!
1,13,1,Angella,Glimmer?
1,13,1,Glimmer,MOM!
1,13,1,Angella,Go on. Go get them
1,13,1,Glimmer,YES!
1,13,1,Bow,"Ha Ha, Glimmer! You're sparkling again!"
1,13,1,Glimmer,Yeah! What I miss?
1,13,1,Adora,The Princesses are united! This is how it's supposed to be.
1,13,1,Mermista,What do you say? Ready to finish this?
1,13,1,Perfuma,Thought you'd never ask
1,13,1,Netossa,We're in
1,13,1,Frosta,Let's do this already
1,13,1,Sea Hawk,ADVENTURE!
1,13,1,Bow,"Adora, it's over! Bright Moon is saved."
1,13,1,Glimmer,And the princesses are finally united! We did it!
1,13,1,Mermista,"That is how it's done in the SEA, really good job"
1,13,1,Netossa,GOOD job Girls! ON to the next.
1,13,1,Frosta,Yeah! We did things ToGEther!
1,13,1,Perfuma,Isn't this wonderful! Ha ha!
1,13,1,Angella,Thank you.
1,13,1,Hordak,"Force Captain, it seems your experiment has failed"
1,13,1,Entrapta,"ON THE CONTRARY! The experiment was a huge success, I know more about first one's tech than ever, this is Just the beginning."
1,13,1,Catra,"I got us closer to conquering Bright Moon than anyone ever has, not to mention the Whispering Woods is still in ruins. Etheria is ours for the taking."
1,13,1,Hordak,"Very Well, force captain Catra.... you will have other chances to prove your worth to me... As my second in command."
2,1,0,Perfuma,"Hey, robot face, watch where you step."
2,1,0,Bow,Incoming.
2,1,0,Mermista,Got it.
2,1,0,Perfuma,"Sorry, Frosta."
2,1,0,Mermista,"Wow, flower princesses can't aim."
2,1,0,Perfuma,I'm working on it.
2,1,0,Frosta,Look out!
2,1,0,Glimmer,Got it.
2,1,0,Glimmer,Thanks for dropping in.
2,1,0,Frosta,"Dropping in, because you dropped him from the sky. Good one."
2,1,1,Adora,Woo-hoo!
2,1,1,Catra,"Oh, cute. You can turn your sword into stuff."
2,1,1,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
2,1,1,Catra,"Did you mean to do that? If you did, it's a terrible weapon."
2,1,1,Adora,Is not.
2,1,2,Frosta,How'd you do that?
2,1,2,Frosta,Can you teleport anything you want? Like a cannon? I can make ice cannonballs.
2,1,2,Glimmer,What? No. Just the staff. It was my dad's-- Ugh.
2,1,2,Glimmer,"Actually, I was sort of in the middle of something here. Do you mind?"
2,1,2,Frosta,It's more effective if you hit their core processing unit.
2,1,2,Glimmer,Ugh. I know. I was about to--
2,1,2,Frosta,Hey. There's another one. Let's get it.
2,1,3,Catra,What are you waiting for? You gonna play me a song on that thing?
2,1,3,Catra,I knew you couldn't do it.
2,1,3,Adora,Did you have to make her so mean?
2,1,3,Light Hope,The simulation is designed for total accuracy.
2,1,3,Light Hope,Is the one you call Catra not mean?
2,1,3,Adora,No. She is.
2,1,3,Light Hope,There. There.
2,1,4,Perfuma,The poor woods.
2,1,4,Perfuma,They'll never be able to regrow if the bots keep attacking.
2,1,4,Bow,Hey!
2,1,4,Bow,I was looking at that.
2,1,4,Frosta,You're welcome.
2,1,5,Adora,I've been training for a month and I haven't gotten any better.
2,1,5,Light Hope,"This performance was, in fact, worse."
2,1,5,Light Hope,Please disregard. My human inspiration protocol is still in the beta stage.
2,1,5,Light Hope,Should I smile more?
2,1,5,Adora,"No, no. It's not you."
2,1,5,Adora,"I wanna be the best She-Ra, I wanna protect the planet."
2,1,5,Adora,"But Catra, she's just in my head."
2,1,5,Light Hope,She has access to your mainframe?
2,1,5,Adora,She isn't actually in my head.
2,1,5,Adora,"When you grow up with someone, they know how to push your buttons."
2,1,5,Light Hope,I can relate. I also have buttons.
2,1,5,Light Hope,"You have come a long way, but there is still much to do."
2,1,5,Light Hope,"You must learn to master your emotions, or you are destined to repeat the mistakes of the last She-Ra."
2,1,5,Adora,"No pressure, huh?"
2,1,5,Light Hope,There is quite a bit of pressure.
2,1,5,Light Hope,Was that not clear?
2,1,5,Adora,"Yeah, no, I got it. So much pressure."
2,1,5,Light Hope,Very well. You must learn by doing.
2,1,6,Kyle,"No. Oh, no."
2,1,6,Catra,Who can tell me what Kyle did wrong?
2,1,6,Lonnie,Where do you start?
2,1,6,Catra,She-Ra is too strong to defeat with force alone.
2,1,6,Catra,But she's slow and easily manipulated.
2,1,6,Kyle,Not again.
2,1,6,Catra,Fix this.
2,1,6,Catra,Then go again.
2,1,6,Catra,Huh?
2,1,6,Catra,What is all this junk?
2,1,6,Entrapta,Isn't it wonderful?
2,1,6,Entrapta,The stuff from my castle arrived.
2,1,6,Catra,Yeah. Wonderful. What's the report from the woods?
2,1,6,Entrapta,Oh! I just received a transmission from one of my bots.
2,1,6,Scorpia,"Oh, boy.  Ouch."
2,1,6,Entrapta,"Oh, wow, it just fell apart with one hit there, didn't it.  I could definitely make some improvements."
2,1,6,Scorpia,"Oh-ho, yeah! Game over."
2,1,6,Catra,"It doesn't matter. We'll just send more bots, and more after that.  They'll be so busy defending their precious trees, we'll conquer the planet before they know what's happened."
2,1,6,Entrapta,I have an even better idea.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"You should've seen it. With the Moonstone super-charged, I've been so much more powerful. I took out, like, at least five bots."
2,1,7,Bow,"Just like the day before, and the day before that."
2,1,7,Glimmer,So? What are we supposed to do? Not fight? We have to protect the woods.
2,1,7,Glimmer,The Horde is going to keep taking ground until it regrows.
2,1,7,Bow,"I know, but how long can we keep this up? Did you learn anything from Light Hope?"
2,1,7,Adora,Uh...
2,1,7,Adora,Getting way better at transforming my sword. Look.
2,1,7,Bow,A pitcher.
2,1,7,Bow,That's so useful.
2,1,7,Glimmer,We can picnic once the woods regrow.
2,1,7,Frosta,We should turn it into a dagger.
2,1,7,Frosta,See me take out that bot with daggers?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Where did you come from?
2,1,7,Frosta,I've been here the whole time.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"Well, we have to go. We have an important meeting."
2,1,7,Frosta,"The war council? I'm heading there, too. Better hurry, you're gonna be late."
2,1,7,Bow,Do we have a new addition to the Best Friends Squad?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Shut up. Ugh.
2,1,7,Perfuma,"Sorry, heh, I think that's my chair."
2,1,7,Mermista,"Yeah, don't you find it helpful to shift perspectives sometimes?"
2,1,7,Glimmer,Aunt Casta! You made it.
2,1,7,Castaspella,"I wouldn't miss it, dearest."
2,1,7,Castaspella,The first war room of the new alliance. How exciting.
2,1,7,Angella,Yes.  It's a shame you couldn't be at the battle where the alliance was formed.
2,1,7,Castaspella,I knew you'd bring that up again.
2,1,7,Angella,We have a great deal to discuss.  Everyone.  Please take your seats.
2,1,7,Angella,"Swift Wind, what news do you bring from your scouting in the west?"
2,1,7,Swift Wind,"The Horde has gained more territory in the west.  But with the help of Netossa and Spinnerella, our forces have managed to re-capture Thaymor. Again."
2,1,7,Swift Wind,"Also, why don't I get a chair? If everyone else has a chair, I want a chair."
2,1,7,Angella,A chair. Of course. I will see to it.
2,1,7,Angella,"Commander Glimmer, how goes the situation in the Whispering Woods?"
2,1,7,Glimmer,"I'm happy to report that we are handling bots, and protecting the woods while it regrows.  Which it is doing.  Very.  Slowly."
2,1,7,Perfuma,"Maybe it's time we stop fighting and start healing.  My powers aren't strong enough to regrow the entire woods on my own, but when we princesses worked together in harmony during the battle of Bright Moon, our powers grew.  We should try to recapture that energy.  Maybe we should hold hands and think healing thoughts."
2,1,7,Bow,"If I may, Your Majesty.  We can't go on like this.  We're defeating the bots, but more keep coming.  While we're using our resources to hold our borders, the Horde hasn't had to deploy a single soldier."
2,1,7,Adora,Typical Catra!
2,1,7,Bow,"I've only been able to recover pieces, seeing as we have never not completely demolished one of these things.  But if we could capture a whole bot, I might be able to program a kill switch.  We could wipe them all out without draining our forces."
2,1,7,Angella,"An excellent idea, Bow. This could turn the tide for us.  Glimmer, you will take your patrol out, and capture a bot for Bow to study and carry out his plan."
2,1,7,Frosta,"Commander, I have some ideas to improve our efficiency. First, we should all have code names."
2,1,7,Frosta,I'd like to be Frostbite. And you could be Sparklebomb. Second--
2,1,7,Glimmer,"Oh, uh, Frosta.  I need you toooo . . . stay back and help Spinnerella and Netossa guard the castle!  Great. Thanks!"
2,1,7,Catra,"With the woods frozen and the princesses distracted by the bots, we've been able to gain significant new ground."
2,1,7,Hordak,"You have not disappointed me, Force Captain.  Clearly, I was wise to promote you."
2,1,7,Entrapta,I'm just gonna borrow this.
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Oh, what is that?"
2,1,7,Catra,"Uh, yes. We've kept the princesses distracted, but we could be doing more."
2,1,7,Catra,"We should be working to take them out, once and for all."
2,1,7,Catra,"Isn't that right, Entrapta? Entrapta!"
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Oh, right."
2,1,7,Entrapta,May I introduce Emily's Kid Sister.
2,1,7,Entrapta,"EKS for short. With First Ones tech at its core, this little beauty has enough power to rival a princess."
2,1,7,Hordak,Impressive indeed. And you can make more of these?
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Yes! I mean, no. I mean, I could.  But I only had enough First Ones tech to make four."
2,1,7,Catra,But I know where we can get more.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"Okay. We'll split up to cover the most ground.  Adora, Bow and I will go east. Mermista and Perfuma, you go west.  Swift Wind, cover the sky and tell us when there's a bot nearby."
2,1,7,Bow,"And, remember, we want an intact bot."
2,1,7,Mermista,"What if it's just, like, a little waterlogged?"
2,1,7,Perfuma,And also covered in ferns that secrete corrosive poison?
2,1,7,Frosta,Or what if it's totally smashed by my ice hammer?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Frosta!  You're supposed to be defending the castle with Netossa and Spinnerella.
2,1,7,Frosta,"I know I ignored orders, but, no offense, those orders were wrong.  You need me here."
2,1,7,Glimmer,You can't just run off whenever you want.
2,1,7,Frosta,But I did. And I'm here now. And I'm not going back.
2,1,7,Glimmer,Fine. You can be in Mermista and Perfuma's patrol.
2,1,7,Frosta,I'm going with you.
2,1,7,Glimmer,Don't push your luck.
2,1,7,Bow,"Uh, guys?  That thing is way more advanced than usual."
2,1,7,Glimmer,Where is it going? Why isn't it attacking the woods?
2,1,7,Adora,It's still just a Horde bot. We know how to handle--
2,1,7,Adora,Okay. That's new.
2,1,7,Glimmer,Ha!
2,1,7,Bow,It's learning!
2,1,7,Adora,"Yeah, well, I'm about to teach it something.  For the honor of Grayskull!"
2,1,7,Adora,What?  We'll capture another bot. That one had it coming.
2,1,7,Adora,Yeesh. I'm sorry I destroyed it.
2,1,7,Swift Wind,"Ooh, that's unnatural. Even for a robot."
2,1,7,Glimmer,Frosta! Do you even listen when people tell you things?
2,1,7,Frosta,What?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Get away from that bot!
2,1,7,Frosta,It's the bot you should be worried about!
2,1,7,Glimmer,Frosta!
2,1,7,Perfuma,There you are. We've been looking everywhere for you.
2,1,7,Mermista,Yeah. Everywhere.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"That was incredibly stupid! You could've gotten hurt, or gotten one of us hurt!"
2,1,7,Frosta,I was just trying to help.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"This is serious, not a game. You need to stop getting in our way!"
2,1,7,Glimmer,"Frosta, wait."
2,1,7,Mermista,Ouch.
2,1,7,Bow,"The Horde's new bots are too fast and too smart.  We'll never be able to catch one. I thought I could help, and be the Rebellion's tech master. But that was obviously a dumb idea."
2,1,7,Adora,"It wasn't. You're the only one who came up with a real plan.  Without it, we'd still just be reacting to the bots.  We need to stop letting the Horde manipulate us.  So let's put our heads together and think."
2,1,7,Bow,"Those bots weren't interested in the woods.  And, they only defended themselves long enough to get away."
2,1,7,Mermista,"Well, that means attacking us wasn't their mission."
2,1,7,Swift Wind,And they all ran off in the same direction.
2,1,7,Perfuma,So whatever they're after is that way.
2,1,7,Adora,"The only thing that's in that direction is -- the Beacon.  I know where the bots are going. And I've got an idea for how to stop them.  Frosta, do you think you can--? Where's Frosta?"
2,1,7,Glimmer,I'll go find her.
2,1,7,Frosta,Come to yell at me more? I just wanted to be your friend.
2,1,7,Glimmer,By ignoring us and throwing yourself into danger?
2,1,7,Frosta,Sorry I don't know how to act. I've never had any friends before!
2,1,7,Frosta,I was eight when I took over the throne.  It's kind of hard to make friends when everyone is your sworn subject.
2,1,7,Glimmer,I know how you feel. I didn't have any friends before Bow and Adora.
2,1,7,Frosta,You? Figured everyone would wanna be your friend.
2,1,7,Glimmer,"Yeah, definitely not everyone.  And I'm still learning how to be a good friend, too.  I'm sorry I yelled. It's just -- I guess you remind me of... me.  And I can do some really dangerous stuff sometimes."
2,1,7,Frosta,I remind you of you?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Ugh. And I even sounded like my mom when I yelled at you.  Please don't make me do that again.
2,1,7,Frosta,Deal.  Does that mean we're friends?
2,1,7,Glimmer,Yes.  And we -- I could really use your help.
2,1,7,Frosta,"You want me to come back?! I knew we'd make a great team!  So, should I do ice hammers or daggers? You're right, one of each!!"
2,1,7,Catra,That place has enough First Ones tech inside to power a whole armada of robots forever.
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Ahhh, I want that!"
2,1,7,Frosta,Ice of you to drop in!
2,1,7,Adora,Switch things up. Keep them guessing.
2,1,7,Bow,We just need to capture one. Take the others out.
2,1,7,Scorpia,"One bot down, but three to go!"
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Fight, EKS's, fight!"
2,1,7,Frosta,"Showed you, bot-face!"
2,1,7,Scorpia,"Ooh, he is not recovering from that."
2,1,7,Entrapta,"Ahhhh, I can't look. Tell me what's happening. No, don't."
2,1,7,Adora,Why can't you be what I want you to be?!!!
2,1,7,Adora,Hmm.
2,1,7,Adora,"Hey, Catra."
2,1,7,Scorpia,It's okay. We have two left.
2,1,7,Entrapta,Do you have tooooo?
2,1,7,Adora,"Bow, look! I got one."
2,1,7,Bow,Adora! Get away from it!
2,1,7,Adora,What just happened . . .?
2,1,7,Bow,It looks like the bots can self-destruct.
2,1,7,Adora,Catra.
2,1,7,Bow,We can't let that one self-destruct!
2,1,7,Adora,Everyone together!
2,1,7,Adora,Whoopsies.
2,1,7,Mermista,"You ready, Ice Princess?"
2,1,7,Frosta,Yeah!!
2,1,7,Bow,"Ha, ha!"
2,1,7,Perfuma,Look!
2,1,7,Frosta,Whoaaaa! Did we do that?
2,1,7,Perfuma,"We did, all of us working together!!!"
2,1,7,Mermista,Personal space.
2,1,7,Catra,You look terrible.
2,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"Catra.  It's been so long. I assumed Hordak finally realized what a lazy, worthless creature you are and banished you."
2,1,7,Catra,Just the opposite. Hordak values me.  I've been busy helping the Horde get closer than ever to defeating the Rebellion. His words.
2,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"If you're doing so well, why are you here?  It's Adora, isn't it?"
2,1,7,Catra,"So?! I let her win one.  We're gaining ground, and our armies are growing!  When they're ready to roll out, I will be at the head!!  And you'll be here rotting."
2,1,7,Catra,Thanks. I needed this.
2,1,7,Frosta,"So, we're okay now that the woods are growing back.  Right?"
2,1,7,Adora,"Light Hope says there's still a lot to fix with the planet, but at least it won't be as easy for the Horde to attack us."
2,1,7,Frosta,"Thanks again for saving me, you know, after that bot threw me off the cliff."
2,1,7,Bow,"Uh, okay. I'm talking into this recorder because that's what the best scientist I ever knew did.  I'm not really sure who I'm talking to. Me, I guess.  So, hi, Future Bow.  We're about to open this thing."
2,1,7,Bow,First Ones tech?  But the only one who knew how to use that was--
2,1,7,Bow,"Hold onto your hat, Future Bow. Entrapta's alive . . . And we left her behind."
2,2,1,Catra,The cities forces have all fled. Dryl is ours.
2,2,1,Scorpia,"All right. I mean I guess it, kind of, was already ours since they're Princess is on our side and all, but the banners, they really make it feel official."
2,2,1,Catra,Where are you?
2,2,1,Scorpia,"That is a great question and the answer is ""I do not know"". Yea, this place is some kind of maze."
2,2,1,Catra,There. That's me. Follow it out when you're done. And hurry up we have work to do.
2,2,1,Adora,"Whewh, getting pretty good huh?"
2,2,1,Light Hope,You have shown improvement. But your attack would have been 57% more effective if you had support from your steed. It is time to bring Swift Wind into your training.
2,2,1,Adora,"Um, shouldn't I work on mastering my own abilities first?"
2,2,1,Light Hope,"As She-Ra, your sacred connection with your steed is as important as any of your physical abilities. He is a part of you, your destinies are intertwined."
2,2,1,Swift Wind,"They sure are! Hi, Adora! I've been here a while but there wasn't a good time for me to make my grand entrance, until now."
2,2,1,Light Hope,I requested his presence. The time has come for the two of you to forge your sacred--
2,2,2,Glimmer,"What do you mean? ""Entrapta's alive""?"
2,2,2,Bow,I couldn't figure out how the Horde was making such big technological advances. But it all makes sense now. They must be holding Entrapta prisoner. I found First Ones tech in this bot. This is what Entrapta was experimenting on before she...
2,2,2,Glimmer,Before we left her behind in the Fright Zone.
2,2,2,Bow,We didn't know.
2,2,2,Glimmer,"It doesn't matter. We should have gone back for her. We should've tried. She got captured trying to save us. Well, we're not just leaving her there now. We've got to rescue her."
2,2,2,Bow,How? We can't just walk into the Fright Zone. That's how we got in this mess in the first place.
2,2,2,Glimmer,Maybe we don't have to. Look.
2,2,2,Bow,"No, the Horde took Dryl."
2,2,2,Glimmer,"We just got word. The Horde has Entrapta, now they have Dryl. The timing can't be a coincidence."
2,2,2,Bow,Of course. They're making her use her own lab.
2,2,2,Glimmer,"We're going to Crypto Castle, we'll find Entrapta and bring her back. No Princess left behind."
2,2,2,Bow,Yes! Totally on board. Let's get Adora.
2,2,2,Glimmer,Adora is out training with Light Hope.
2,2,2,Bow,What about the other Princesses?
2,2,2,Glimmer,"Entrapta got taken trying to save us, Bow. I'm not going to be responsible for losing anyone else."
2,2,3,Adora,"Uhhh, Light Hope?"
2,2,3,Swift Wind,Did I break her? Was it when I went through her head?
2,2,3,Light Hope,The time has come for the two of you to forge your sacred bond. --I -- Is there something wrong?
2,2,3,Swift Wind,"Well, I, yea. You kind of froze there for a second."
2,2,3,Adora,Are you okay?
2,2,3,Light Hope,"Forgive me, my system is overloading. I may have to delay today's training so that I can rest."
2,2,3,Adora,Is there anything that I can do to help?
2,2,3,Light Hope,"Perhaps. This is the Watchtower. Once it allowed me to access my planetary mainframe. But it was destroyed by Mara when she lost control and attacked the planet. I have been functioning at only a fraction of my power ever since. If you can repair the Watchtower, my capabilities will improve, and training can commence."
2,2,3,Adora,"Fix the Watchtower, got it."
2,2,3,Light Hope,Only then --
2,2,3,Adora,"Okay, so we're just gonna... We're just gonna go."
2,2,4,Bow,Any sign of Entrapta in the castle?
2,2,4,Glimmer,Nothing. And as usual that place is impossible to navigate.
2,2,4,Kyle,Hello? Please say you're on your way back. I need backup! Entrapta's new invention has lost it!
2,2,4,Entrapta,"Bot #437 seems to be having some sort of existential crisis. Down, boy, down!"
2,2,4,Catra,"Pull it together Kyle, you're fine."
2,2,4,Entrapta,"Stop it! Please, why are you doing this to me?"
2,2,4,Bow,"Entrapta, she's really alive."
2,2,4,Glimmer,And they're hurting her.
2,2,4,Bow,Wait!
2,2,4,Glimmer,Where is she?
2,2,4,Bow,Glimmer we've got to get out of her now!
2,2,4,Catra,Get them!
2,2,4,Bow,Wait. Isn't this where we started?
2,2,4,Glimmer,I hate this place!
2,2,4,Catra,I see the rebels have sent their finest.
2,2,4,Glimmer,Bow!
2,2,4,Bow,"Glimmer, wake up!"
2,2,4,Catra,What did you just do to me?
2,2,4,Bow,Get back.
2,2,5,Swift Wind,"Adora and Swift Wind, on an adventure. Fix'n a thing that Mara broke. When she went nuts."
2,2,5,Adora,"Swift Wind, could you not do that?"
2,2,5,Swift Wind,Just trying to keep us entertained while we look for this Watchtower.  Any sign of it?
2,2,5,Adora,There's nothing here but grass. Maybe Light Hope got the location wrong.
2,2,5,Swift Wind,"No, I don't think she did. I definitely sense something here, something ancient and magical."
2,2,5,Adora,Where?
2,2,5,Swift Wind,"I'm not sure. Perhaps if we were to combine our efforts, my intuitive powers might increase."
2,2,5,Adora,"No that's ok. I just, just have to keep looking. It has to be here somewhere."
2,2,5,Swift Wind,"I could be wrong, but I'm sensing something's bothering you."
2,2,5,Adora,I'm just really focused on fixing Light Hope. Like you should be.
2,2,5,Swift Wind,"No, you're troubled about something else. As your magnificent steed I am attuned to your emotions."
2,2,5,Adora,"Okay, can you stay out of my head, please?"
2,2,5,Swift Wind,I'm not in your head. You're just very bad at hiding your feelings. Is it about me?
2,2,5,Adora,"I'm fine and no, it's not about you."
2,2,5,Swift Wind,Is it Bow? Glimmer? Catra? The Horde? The crushing weight of your new responsibilities as the savior of Etheria?
2,2,5,Adora,"Stop. I'm fine, I promise. Just... let me think."
2,2,5,Swift Wind,Okay. I'm gonna do a few loop-de-loops.
2,2,5,Adora,Hey! Swift Wind.
2,2,5,Swift Wind,What's up?
2,2,5,Adora,I think I found the Watchtower.
2,2,6,Bow,We took a hostage! We're supposed to be the good guys. Maybe we should just let her go...
2,2,6,Glimmer,Let her go? Did she let us go? No! She let the Horde torture us.
2,2,6,Bow,"Uh, yeah, because she's a bad guy."
2,2,6,Glimmer,"Listen. We didn't mean for this to happen. But it did, and now we should use it to our advantage. We're taking you to Bright Moon. If your people want you back they'll have to give us Entrapta."
2,2,6,Catra,Entrapta? Who's that?
2,2,6,Glimmer,We know you have her! Where is she? What are you doing to her?
2,2,6,Bow,Glimmer.
2,2,6,Catra,"Ohhh, Entrapta. You mean the Princess you left behind to die? Ha. Don't worry. We're taking good care of her."
2,2,6,Glimmer,On your feet Horde scum.
2,2,6,Catra,Whoops. I can't walk. Unless you want to untie me.
2,2,6,Glimmer,Nice try. I'll just teleport us there.
2,2,6,Bow,"Uh, Glimmer, can I talk to you real quick? Bright Moon is pretty far away. Shouldn't you wait until we get closer to teleport us there? You don't want to run out of power and get us stuck out here. Especially with her."
2,2,6,Glimmer,Fine.
2,2,7,Swift Wind,Wow. Mara really did a number on this place.
2,2,7,Adora,"So, let's put it back together. For the Honor of Grayskull!"
2,2,7,Swift Wind,She-Ra and Swift Wind. Forging a sacred bond. Fixing a magic tower. With a magical sword.
2,2,8,Bow,"Hey, are you okay?"
2,2,8,Catra,Like you care.
2,2,8,Bow,"We do, actually. The Rebellion treats it's prisoners with compassion."
2,2,8,Catra,You princess-types have to be about the bleeding hearts. Everything with you is about the power of friendship. How's that working out for you?
2,2,8,Bow,Come on. I bet even the Horde has friends. What about Adora?
2,2,8,Bow,"You two grew up together, right? What was she like as a kid?"
2,2,8,Bow,Glimmer and I have known each other forever too. She'd teleport to the roof to get my lost arrows when I was learning to shoot.
2,2,8,Catra,"Wow, you two must be really close? Sounds like Glimmer would do anything for you, huh?"
2,2,8,Bow,Absolutely. She's my best friend.
2,2,8,Catra,Good to know.
2,2,8,Glimmer,Bow!
2,2,8,Catra,"Oh, hey princess."
2,2,8,Glimmer,How are you such a nightmare?!
2,2,8,Catra,"Ah, years of practice."
2,2,8,Bow,Can we please discuss this when we're not hurtling to our deaths?
2,2,8,Glimmer,You know what? I'm ready to see if cats really do land on their feet?
2,2,8,Bow,"Please don't do that, she is attached to me! Glimmer!"
2,2,8,Glimmer,Okay.
2,2,8,Glimmer,Not a fan of water huh? Get off of me!
2,2,8,Bow,Glimmer! Help!
2,2,8,Bow,"Okay, ready to be rescued from this whenever you are."
2,2,8,Glimmer,Just need a minute to rest.
2,2,8,Bow,"Um, what could you do with ten seconds?"
2,2,8,Catra,Seriously? You guys are terrible at this.
2,2,8,Catra,At least we're all in one piece. Can't say the same for Entrapta.
2,2,8,Bow,"Glimmer, are you ok?"
2,2,8,Catra,Aww. What's wrong? Sleepy after all that magic?
2,2,8,Glimmer,"I'm fine. You're not worth my time. C'mon, it's a long walk to Bright Moon. Put more ropes on her."
2,2,9,Scorpia,"What do you mean there's no sign of her? Where could they have gone? Think, think Scorpia. Do we tell Hordak? Send out a search-party? Put up posters? How are we gonna find Catra? I mean if somebody has touched a hair on her head, I don't know... huh?"
2,2,9,Scorpia,"Oh, she's signaling us. We can follow this right to her. Catra, you beautiful genius, I'm coming!"
2,2,10,Swift Wind,Try concentrating. Focus the She-Ra. She-Ra...
2,2,10,Adora,I can't concentrate when you're distracting me! This worked in Salineas.
2,2,10,Swift Wind,"Hey, you know what might help?  Loop-de-loops, with me. Get on my back."
2,2,10,Adora,"Swift Wind, you're not taking this seriously."
2,2,10,Swift Wind,I'm just saying everything's better with loop-de-loops.
2,2,10,Adora,"It's fine, I got this."
2,2,10,Adora,Still got this.
2,2,11,Catra,"I don't know about you guys, but I'm beat. Getting held hostage is so much work. Almost as exhausting as torturing Entrapta every day."
2,2,11,Glimmer,Uhg. Just ignore her.
2,2,11,Catra,You're looking pretty tired too princess. Running out of glitter?
2,2,11,Glimmer,"Bow, can't you keep her mouth shut?"
2,2,11,Bow,"I tried, but she bites."
2,2,11,Glimmer,"How did Adora take years of this? She didn't run away from the Horde, she ran away from you."
2,2,11,Catra,"And where is she now? Off being She-Ra? Get used to it. You think she's not going to leave you behind, too, Sparkles?"
2,2,11,Scorpia,Don't move!
2,2,12,Adora,How's that look?
2,2,12,Swift Wind,"You know what? I don't think that one goes there after all. In fact, it might be upside down. Maybe you should take it all apart and start again? You seem stressed. Why don't we list all our favorite things until we feel better? I'll go first. Apples, hay, toppling unjust hierarchies, apples... Wait, I said that already."
2,2,12,Adora,What are you doing?
2,2,12,Swift Wind,I'm helping! I'm She-Ra's steed and that's what I do.
2,2,12,Adora,This isn't helping! Can you just...
2,2,12,Swift Wind,Adora!
2,2,13,Scorpia,"Catra, are you okay? Did they hurt you? I will crush them."
2,2,13,Glimmer,She's fine. We want to make a trade. We'll release Catra if you release Entrapta.
2,2,13,Catra,I have a better trade. You release me right now or we'll finish Entrapta off once and for all.
2,2,13,Bow,What?
2,2,13,Glimmer,She's bluffing.
2,2,13,Catra,"Scorpia, get Kyle on the comm."
2,2,13,Entrapta,"No, no, no! Wait! Oh no."
2,2,13,Kyle,"Force Captain, I knew you'd call me back. What do I do?"
2,2,13,Catra,"If you don't hear back from me in thirty seconds, take Entrapta out."
2,2,13,Kyle,What?
2,2,13,Entrapta,Just relax. We'll figure this out. Everything's okay.
2,2,13,Glimmer,Two can play at that game.
2,2,13,Scorpia,Catra! If you touch her again...
2,2,13,Catra,"Easy there Big Gal, she's not going to try anything. They're noble rebels after all. They play by the rules."
2,2,13,Bow,"Glimmer, stop!"
2,2,13,Glimmer,"This isn't fair.  After everything she's done? After what she did to us? We're just supposed to let her go? How do we know they'd really get rid of Entrapta, Bow? They need her."
2,2,13,Bow,We can't take that chance. We're not them.
2,2,13,Scorpia,Oh. Oh! Come here! Come on. I'm just so glad this nightmare is over.
2,2,13,Catra,Wow. I didn't think you'd actually buy that.
2,2,13,Glimmer,"We held up our end of the bargain. Now, show us that Entrapta's alive."
2,2,13,Catra,"You and Adora are perfect for each other, I'll give you that. Earnest, naive, ridiculously easy to manipulate. It's adorable. And it's why you're never going to win. Kyle, if you actually took me seriously just then, call it off."
2,2,13,Entrapta,Kyle isn't available at the moment.
2,2,13,Entrapta,"But I've got it under control. Don't worry, this was just the prototype. The next model will be much, much bigger."
2,2,13,Bow,Entrapta? What's going on?
2,2,13,Catra,Oh hey. You wanna talk to her?
2,2,13,Entrapta,"Oh, hi Bow. What are you doing there?"
2,2,13,Glimmer,"Just hang on Entrapta, we're going to rescue you."
2,2,13,Entrapta,Oh good! Rescue me from what?
2,2,13,Glimmer,From the Horde!
2,2,13,Entrapta,"Oh, well, that's nice of you. But all of my stuff is here now, so probably I'll just stay. Thanks anyway though."
2,2,13,Bow,"Entrapta, are you on the Horde's side now?"
2,2,13,Entrapta,"I'm on the side of science. But I am living at the Fright Zone now, and the Horde is supplying me with tools and materials for my work. So, yes? I guess?"
2,2,13,Catra,Did I forget to mention that? Ha. Oops.
2,2,13,Entrapta,But don't worry about me. I love it here. I've made unbelievable progress in my research. And the Horde has been so supportive. I'm getting closer every day to unraveling the mysteries of Etheria. Hacking the Black Garnet was just the first step.
2,2,13,Bow,That was you?
2,2,13,Catra,So much for the power of friendship.
2,2,13,Bow,"Come on Glimmer, lets go. Glimmer?"
2,2,14,Swift Wind,Adora! Adora! Are you okay?
2,2,14,Adora,I don't know what I'm doing. I don't even know what this Watchtower is supposed to do or how it's supposed to help.
2,2,14,Swift Wind,If that's the case then why are you doing all of this anyway?
2,2,14,Adora,"I need to be a better She-Ra than Mara. I need to know how to control my powers so I don't hurt people like she did. Light Hope is the only one that can teach me, and she's broken."
2,2,14,Swift Wind,You're really freaking out about this Mara thing aren't you?
2,2,14,Adora,How could I not? She ruined everything. And I don't know how to fix it.
2,2,14,Swift Wind,"I'm sorry I didn't take this mission more seriously. The truth is, I'm just so excited to be your steed. I guess I just got carried away."
2,2,14,Adora,"I'm sorry I dragged you into this with me. You were just a horse before I accidentally zapped you with my sword. If it we'rent for me, you would've been able to live out the rest of your days carefree in a nice pasture in Thaymore."
2,2,14,Swift Wind,"Adora, I wouldn't trade my voice and my wings for anything. I've got the chance to change the world now. To make it better than when I found it. I can't imagine ever going back. Can you?"
2,2,14,Adora,No. I don't think I can.
2,2,15,Bow,Glimmer!
2,2,15,Catra,"Forget the princess, she's got no power! Get him!"
2,2,15,Glimmer,"I'm not as naive as you think. Turns out I saved a little magic, just for you!"
2,2,15,Scorpia,No!
2,2,16,Adora,Is this...?
2,2,16,Swift Wind,Our sacred bond?
2,2,16,Swift Wind,This is it. This is what I've been sensing. This is the epicenter.
2,2,16,Adora,"She-Ra destroyed this place, now it's up to She-Ra to fix it. For the honor of Grayskull!"
2,2,16,Swift Wind,"Don't worry, I got this. Loop-de-loops!"
2,2,16,Adora,Woo-hoo! Wow!
2,2,16,Swift Wind,Not a bad team. Looks like we're getting the hang of this.
2,2,17,Light Hope,Then I will be back to operation... My sensors indicate they fixed it. Good.
2,2,18,Bow,"At least we know for sure that Entrapta's alive, and working for the Horde, making weapons to wipe us out."
2,2,18,Adora,"Hey guys. You'll never guess what Swift Wind and I did today. We restored a First Ones' Watchtower so Light Hope can balance the planet, and we brought a whole field back to life and... What happened to you?"
2,2,18,Glimmer,"Oh Adora, we've got a lot to catch you up on."
2,3,1,Hordak,Finally.
2,3,1,Hordak,Useless.
2,3,1,Other,Useless.
2,3,3,Adora,I still can't believe Entrapta's working for the Horde. Shadow Weaver messed with her mind. She must have. Right?
2,3,3,Glimmer,"I don't know. She seemed normal when we talked to her. Entrapta-normal, but still, she wants to be with the Horde. They do have better tech than us. But we have magic on our side."
2,3,3,Bow,Magic and tech aren't totally separate things. Entrapta is one of the only people who really understands that. She got closer to combining them than anyone else. And...now she's with the Horde.
2,3,3,Bow,"Well, who needs Entrapta? You've got Bow, tech master and premier member of the Etherian Maker Community."
2,3,3,Bow,"Ah. Yeah, uh, meant to do that."
2,3,3,Swift Wind,"Ahoy! Ha ha, be there in a sec."
2,3,3,Swift Wind,"Comrades! I spotted buildings ahead, the outpost is close."
2,3,3,Glimmer,"Entrapta made her decision. We can't change that. But we can focus on our mission and help all our people. We lost all contact with the farming outpost of Alwyn a week ago. The Horde hasn't been reported in the area, but we can't be too careful."
2,3,3,Adora,They're definitely involved. They always are.
2,3,3,Glimmer,"We can handle the Horde. I don't care if they do have Entrapta's inventions, they're no match for us! We'll handle this the way we always do."
2,3,3,Adora,Brute Strength?
2,3,3,Swift Wind,Almost dying?
2,3,3,Glimmer,"No—and no! By sticking together, and never giving up."
2,3,3,Bow,Yeah! Best Friend Quad to the rescue!
2,3,3,Bow,Because there's four of us?
2,3,3,Bow,"Okay, taking that one off the list."
2,3,5,Entrapta,Hm.
2,3,5,Entrapta,"Emily, hand me a six sided hex driver."
2,3,5,Entrapta,"You're right, Emily, how can we possibly work like this?"
2,3,7,Catra,"Uh, hello? Lord Hordak?"
2,3,7,Hordak,"State your purpose, Force Captain Catra."
2,3,7,Catra,"Lord Hordak, I just thought we should, uh, you know, touch base, like you used to with Shadow Weaver. Figured we could establish a daily check-in—"
2,3,7,Hordak,"So, I'm to understand you've disturbed me for no reason."
2,3,7,Catra,"Uh, not for no reason. We need to plan our next move against the Rebellion. The Horde's in a better spot than ever—"
2,3,7,Hordak,Was squandering our advantage while the Whispering Woods regrew part of your plan?
2,3,7,Hordak,Was letting yourself get captured? Etheria's atmosphere has proven to be a complicating variable in my experiments.
2,3,7,Catra,I—
2,3,7,Hordak,"I just removed that variable. Tell me, Force Captain, how is your breathing?"
2,3,7,Hordak,"Pathetic. Just like everything on this backwards planet. Do you know what the definition of failure is, Force Captain?"
2,3,7,Hordak,"Failure is when something ceases to serve a purpose. When that happens, it becomes worthless to me. Thus far, your performance has been lacking."
2,3,7,Catra,"I haven't failed yet. No one knows how to take the princesses down better than me. Trust me, and let me do that."
2,3,7,Hordak,You say you can defeat the Rebellion?
2,3,7,Hordak,Prove it. You are dismissed.
2,3,7,Other,Pathetic. Pathetic. Pathetic.
2,3,9,Swift Wind,"Uh, hello? I thought you should know, I'm sensing something weird the closer we get to the outpost."
2,3,9,Adora,Weird? Like what?
2,3,9,Swift Wind,"I can't describe it, just...weird. What is this place?"
2,3,9,Glimmer,"Alwyn is the Rebellion's biggest supplier of—uh, well, supplies. It's basically one big orchard. One big, happy—incredibly creepy orchard."
2,3,9,Swift Wind,What? Creepy apples taste as good as normal apples.
2,3,9,Glimmer,The outpost must be up ahead.
2,3,9,Adora,I don't see any Horde soldiers. I actually don't see anyone. Where are they?
2,3,9,Glimmer,Maybe they're all inside?
2,3,9,Bow,"Let me take a look. I've upgraded my tracker pad to detect Horde signals. If they're here, we'll find them with this."
2,3,9,Bow,"Oh, man. I must've broken something during the upgrade. Not to worry, I can fix this."
2,3,9,Bow,I don't know how to fix this.
2,3,9,Glimmer,"It's okay! Whatever's going on here, we'll solve it. Nothing gets past us!"
2,3,9,Glimmer,Even if people used to tell stories about Alwyn being haunted.
2,3,9,Adora,Haunted? Like with ghosts?
2,3,9,Glimmer,"It's just stories. And even if it wasn't, we'd handle them. No reason to be scared."
2,3,9,Adora,"Huh. Well, Shadow Weaver used to tell me about ghosts when I was a kid in the Horde. Like the story of the Weeping Princess, a vengeful spirit who roams Etheria looking for victims. You know she's coming for you by the sound of weeping right before she strikes."
2,3,9,Swift Wind,What was that?
2,3,9,Glimmer,What?
2,3,9,Swift Wind,"I'm not sure, I thought I heard someone. A voice."
2,3,9,Adora,The Weeping Princess?
2,3,9,Swift Wind,"No. Someone's here, I'm sure of it. We have to find them."
2,3,11,Catra,"Third Battalion is closest. If they move on Erlandia, the Rebellion will have to answer."
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Uh, yeah, small problem? Um, the Third Battalion is refusing to fight because they don't have armor. They've put in...where is it...um, six requests for resupply. Didn't you see these?"
2,3,11,Catra,"I've been a little busy, you know, almost toppling Bright Moon and coming closer than anyone ever has to conquering the planet for the Horde? Not that anyone seems to care."
2,3,11,Scorpia,I care.
2,3,11,Catra,Fine. Give them the armor.
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Ah. Okay, um...boy, I'd sure like to do that, uh...but the armory is out of armor."
2,3,11,Catra,So have them make more.
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Okay, just gotta find that file."
2,3,11,Scorpia,"They're just, they're so slidey, and slippery."
2,3,11,Catra,How am I supposed to defeat the Rebellion when all I do is this stupid busy work? I bet Shadow Weaver didn't have to deal with any of this.
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Uh, these are her files, so, she probably did? Just saying, that's—that's a guess on my part."
2,3,11,Entrapta,Hi.
2,3,11,Catra,You're not a prisoner anymore. You don't have to sneak around.
2,3,11,Entrapta,"The ducts are faster, and I don't have time to waste. I need a six-sided hex driver right now."
2,3,11,Catra,I'm the one who doesn't have time to waste. Aren't you some kind of genius? Make do with what you have.
2,3,11,Entrapta,"Of course I could, but it's the principle. Always use the proper tool for the job. If you can't help me, it's fine, I saw one in Hordak's lab."
2,3,11,Catra,"I know you're new to the Fright Zone, and possibly to being around people in general, but Hordak isn't somebody to mess with. Under no circumstances will you go anywhere near Hordak's sanctum."
2,3,11,Entrapta,"Ooh. He calls his lab a sanctum. Oh, that is so classy!"
2,3,11,Catra,Focus! I need you to promise that you will stay away from Hordak. Promise!
2,3,11,Entrapta,"Okay, okay! I promise."
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Catra! Here it is! Oh, okay, so the armory can't make more armor because they are...out of irid—do-iridul-lum? Irideli—the point is, they're out of the shiny stuff they need to make armor."
2,3,11,Catra,So where do we get more?
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Oh, uh, I don't have a file for that."
2,3,11,Catra,"I'll handle it myself. But keep and eye on Entrapta, and make sure she doesn't go anywhere near Hordak."
2,3,11,Scorpia,"Got it, boss. I won't let her out of my sight. Now, you didn't happen to see which way she went, did you?"
2,3,11,Scorpia,You know what? I'll figure it out. I'll figure it out.
2,3,13,Adora,Hello?
2,3,13,Swift Wind,"Ahh!  Uh, uh, I mean . . . whooo did that?  Bow-man, tch, you gotta pull yourself together!"
2,3,13,Swift Wind,"I'll wait out here in case anyone tries to sneak up on you.  Also, this door is too small for horses, which is rude."
2,3,13,Glimmer,"Okay.  On three.  One, two, THREE!!"
2,3,13,Adora,"The food is cold.  Whoever lives here left in a hurry, but it was . . . a while ago."
2,3,13,Bow,There's no sign of the Horde.  There's no sign of a struggle at all.  They just . . . left.
2,3,13,Adora,"This is just like the story of the Headless Princess.  She stalks the night, pulling people out of their beds, leaving nothing but bloody footprints!"
2,3,13,Swift Wind,Whaddya find!!!
2,3,13,Swift Wind,Sorry.  I . . . don't like being out here by myself.
2,3,13,Glimmer,We should check out the other buildings.
2,3,13,Bow,"Hey, Guys!"
2,3,13,Adora,Sorry.  What did you say?
2,3,13,Bow,Does that look familiar to you.
2,3,13,Adora,I'm not sure.  Maybe it's . . .
2,3,13,Adora,"Huh . . . Uhhhhh, Glimmer?"
2,3,13,Glimmer,I'm so sorry.  I have no idea why I did that.
2,3,13,Adora,"Ah, this place is weird.  Like the Lair of the Undead Princess!  Where she lures soldiers to their doom!"
2,3,13,Bow,"Undead princess?  The Horde really had a theme, huh?"
2,3,13,Adora,Oh . . . You're right!  Wow.  I can't believe I'm just realizing this now.
2,3,13,Glimmer,"Weird or not, we have a mission.  Something happened here that forced these people to flee their home.  We have to get to the bottom of this."
2,3,15,Entrapta,"Ethical dilemma number . . . ahhhhhhhhhhh . . . sixty-three.  I told Catra I wouldn't go into Hordak's lab.  But, if she never finds out, does it count?  I could just pop in, grab the tool, and then pop out.  No one would ever know.  But, I would know.  Ahhhh, I shouldn't do it.  Or should I?  Nooo, I shouldn't."
2,3,15,Entrapta,A six-sided hex driver!
2,3,15,Entrapta,This is amazing!!
2,3,15,Entrapta,Ohhh . . .
2,3,15,Entrapta,"Well, there's no reason to get huffy because an experiment fails.  Failure is a vital part of scientific endeavor."
2,3,15,Entrapta,"What if I have given up on you after the first explosion?  Or the fiftieth?!  I know, I should leave.  But I have to stay, for science!!!"
2,3,17,Glimmer,Huh?  Hmmm.
2,3,17,Glimmer,It's totally abandoned.
2,3,17,Adora,Do you guys hear that?
2,3,17,Swift Wind,Yes!  Finally!  I told you.  It's a weird sound.
2,3,17,Adora,It's like something . . . someone is singing!
2,3,17,Glimmer,I don't hear anything.  It's probably just the wind.
2,3,17,Bow,"Okay.  I'm hearing something, too."
2,3,17,Adora,There!  Something's there! For the Honor of Grayskull!
2,3,17,Glimmer,Wait!
2,3,17,Bow,Adora!
2,3,19,Entrapta,Hello.  You're blocking my light.  If you could just step aside . . .
2,3,19,Hordak,Get!  OUT!!!
2,3,19,Entrapta,"Well, just a sec.  I'm almost finished."
2,3,19,Entrapta,Okay.  All done.  Byyyee!
2,3,19,Hordak,There will be dire consequences for this flagrant breach of conduct.
2,3,19,Entrapta,"You were using uninsulated cables.  I, uh, replaced them for you.  Try it again.  It should hold the charge, now."
2,3,19,Hordak,She was . . . right.
2,3,19,Entrapta,Of course I was right!
2,3,19,Entrapta,"It's beautiful!  It's a power source, isn't it?  What are you building that needs so much power?"
2,3,19,Entrapta,"I recognize these formulas.  You're experimenting with portals?  But that's . . . I mean, I'm familiar with the concept, but multi-dimensional gates are purely theoretical.  No one's every come close to actually achieving one.  Right?"
2,3,19,Hordak,"Obviously, someone from a backwater planet such as yours couldn't possibly comprehend it."
2,3,19,Entrapta,"Hey!  All right.  I'm the one who got your power source working, so . . . tell me everything!!"
2,3,19,Hordak,Portals aren't theoretical.  They're real.  And I'm going to open one.
2,3,19,Entrapta,"You are?!  Ahhhhh.  Can I help you?!!  Ah, just think of the possibilities!  You could . . . transport troops, and, and weapons . . . whatever you need from one side of the planet to the other!"
2,3,19,Hordak,You think too small.  Unsurprising.  You can't begin to understand the potential a device of this nature will possess.
2,3,19,Entrapta,"Wait!  If Etheria is a backwater planet, does that mean there are others?"
2,3,19,Hordak,Of course.  There are countless galaxies filled with countless other worlds.  Etheria is the only planet I've ever encountered that does not seem to understand that.
2,3,19,Entrapta,Other planets?  And you've . . . been there?
2,3,21,Catra,"I've contacted every mine under Horde control, but none of them have the material to make more armor, and without the armor, I can't attack Erlandia.  You're trying to sabotage me!!  Where's the missing file?!!"
2,3,21,Shadow Weaver,The material you seek comes from the foundry.  Right here in the Fright Zone.
2,3,21,Catra,Fine.
2,3,21,Shadow Weaver,"Being me isn't quite what you imagined, is it?  I suppose you thought Hordak would let you . . . run things now."
2,3,21,Catra,He does.  I can do what I want.
2,3,21,Shadow Weaver,"But he'll never trust you with his real plans.  Don't take it personally.  He never did with me, either."
2,3,21,Catra,"I don't know what you're talking about.  Maybe Hordak didn't trust you, but he trusts me plenty."
2,3,23,Bow,Ooahh!
2,3,23,Adora,The light came from around hear.
2,3,23,Bow,There!  It's over . . . !
2,3,23,Adora,Where'd it go?  Did I get it?
2,3,23,Glimmer,Ahhh!  Run the other way!!
2,3,23,Swift Wind,"She-Ra, do something!"
2,3,23,Adora,Like what?!!  Flail at them again?!!  I can handle the Horde.  I can't handle this!  This is like what . . .
2,3,23,Glimmer,Stop telling ghost stories!!  I've been terrified since we got here!!!  Catra was right!  I'm terrible at this!
2,3,23,Bow,And I can't replace Entrapta!  I can't even make my tracker pad work!
2,3,23,Swift Wind,I'm still hearing stuff coming from the big stone pointy thing!
2,3,23,Bow,From the pointy . . .   Hold on.
2,3,23,Glimmer,What are you doing?!  Bow!
2,3,23,Bow,Of course.  This place.  It's a First One's ruin.  And these aren't ghosts.  They're holograms!
2,3,23,Adora,I'm pretty sure holograms can't walk around on their own like this.
2,3,23,Bow,"But, look at them.  Really look at them."
2,3,23,Glimmer,No thanks!  I'm good!
2,3,23,Adora,It's . . . it's like a recording.
2,3,23,Glimmer,Ahhhh.  She's waving!
2,3,23,Glimmer,"Actually, you know what?  It's still creepy."
2,3,23,Bow,I think I know where they're coming from.  Come on!
2,3,25,Scorpia,"Catra!  Catra!  Hey, Catra!"
2,3,25,Scorpia,"Oh, wow.  You are fast.  Anyway, I found the file, and guess what."
2,3,25,Catra,The material is produced right here in the Fright Zone?
2,3,25,Scorpia,Beautiful and brilliant.
2,3,25,Catra,Where's Entrapta?!  You're supposed to be watching her!
2,3,25,Scorpia,"You know, she is, she's, she's . . . I don't know where she is, truthfully, but I'm gonna fix that because that's just the kind of friend I am.  You're welcome."
2,3,27,Entrapta,"This is probably the max with what you've got to work with here.  If we had some First One's tech, we could generate even more voltage."
2,3,27,Catra,"I'm sorry, Lord Hordak.  Entrapta is still new here.  I, I, I, I promise, she will never bother you again."
2,3,27,Hordak,"You are the one bothering me, Force Captain . . . with your unwelcome intrusion!  I.  Am.  Working.  With Entrapta's assistance."
2,3,27,Entrapta,"Did you hear that, Emily? I've never had a lab partner before!"
2,3,29,Swift Wind,This is it!  The noise is coming from here!
2,3,29,Adora,It looks like Light Hope's beacon.
2,3,29,Bow,"It's an antenna.  I'm guessing this outpost is built on some kind of First Ones communication hub.  When the Black Garnet disrupted the planet, it must have caused the hub to power up.  It's trying to send old stored messages.  With you translating, we should be able to turn it off."
2,3,29,Adora,So . . . these are First Ones?
2,3,29,Bow,Yeah.  Why?
2,3,29,Adora,"It's just . . . I've been thinking of them as these big epic figures.  But they're regular people, . . . sending messages to their loved ones.  Messages that were never received because of what Mara did to the planet."
2,3,29,Adora,"Be at rest, now."
2,3,29,Bow,The farmers must have fled from the “ghosts” when this thing turned itself on.  We should be able to get them a message that it's safe to return.
2,3,29,Glimmer,"Way to go!  I think the Rebellion is going to do just fine with you, Master-maker Bow!"
2,3,29,Bow,"Thanks, Glimmer!  Now that the antenna is powered down, everything should be back to normal."
2,3,29,Bow,It's that message again.  It looks like First Ones writing.
2,3,29,Swift Wind,Huh.  But we powered down the antenna.
2,3,29,Adora,"Well, if it is First Ones writing, I can't read it.  It's way too degraded."
2,3,29,Glimmer,"You said it yourself, Bow.  Your pad must be broken."
2,3,29,Bow,Yeah . . . that must be it.
2,4,0,Adora,"Ooh, okay. We need to find a way to reclaim the Horde-occupied fortress for The Rebellion. So how are we gonna do this?"
2,4,0,Glimmer,I'll teleport ahead to scout out a path through their defenses.
2,4,0,Bow,And I'll quietly shoot the closest turrets with my trick-arrows.
2,4,0,Adora,You'll have the advantage in a sneak-attack. ...Go!
2,4,0,Bow,Yes! And now--
2,4,0,Adora,He's...dead...
2,4,0,Bow,"Oh, what?! Tiny Bow, you will be avenged!"
2,4,0,Adora,That clearly isn't going to work. Let's try this again.
2,4,1,Bow,I shouldn't be dead. That turret came out of nowhere...
2,4,1,Glimmer,"That's because you failed to make a successful observation check. If we're going to retake the pass, we have to be prepared for anything."
2,4,1,Adora,"The pass is the only way in or out of this region. According to the reports, the Horde seized it while we were busy defending Bright Moon, so it's crucial that we get it back."
2,4,1,Bow,Why does that mean I have to die? And after I made these for you.
2,4,1,Adora,"Look, our plans always fall apart. Always! It would be impressive if it wasn't terrifying."
2,4,1,Glimmer,"We have gotten really good at improvising, though."
2,4,1,Adora,"If we're gonna pull this off, we need to come up with a plan that won't fall apart, and a plan that takes into account everything the Horde could possibly throw at us, including surprise attacks."
2,4,1,Bow,"Okay, but you're breaking Tiny Bow's heart. I mean, look at his face!"
2,4,1,Glimmer,He's smiling.
2,4,1,Bow,"Through his pain, Glimmer. Through his pain!"
2,4,1,Adora,"Guys, this pass is important. The Horde is not going to give it up without a fight. It's obviously going to be guarded by their very best and brightest..."
2,4,2,Scorpia,"Move those big weapon-y things! Flap those banners! Uh--keep doing whatever it is you're doing, guy I'm pointing at! Now do a different thing! And look sharp, Force Captain's orders!"
2,4,2,Scorpia,Catra left me in charge. Me. Can you believe it?!
2,4,2,Lonnie,"Uh, no. I really can't."
2,4,2,Scorpia,"Ah, me neither. She must really trust me... I can't let her down. Kyle! Man the parapets!"
2,4,2,Kyle,I don't know what those are.
2,4,2,Scorpia,Then find out!
2,4,2,Scorpia,"""Scorpia, you're in charge of the fortress,"" she said. ""Even you can't mess this up,"" she said. Even me. She's thinking about me! Ah... Should I get her a 'Thank You' gift? What's her favorite color? KYLE, what are you doing?!"
2,4,2,Kyle,"Uh, you said--I--"
2,4,2,Scorpia,Go find out Catra's favorite color!
2,4,2,Scorpia,"Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey----you guys know Catra. W-what would she like? I need it to be something that says... 'Thank you', but also----'We are soulmates tied together by the beautiful threads of fate...'"
2,4,2,Lonnie,"We should spend less time talking about Catra, and more time talking about the defenses."
2,4,2,Lonnie,The reason we're here!
2,4,2,Scorpia,"Okay, you don't need to remind me. My wildcat is counting on me, and I won't let her down. For Catra, I will defend this pass with my very life!"
2,4,2,Lonnie,Wrong pass.
2,4,2,Scorpia,"Yes, this is the pass I will defend with my very life. No reason to worry at all."
2,4,3,Adora,"Clearly, that last plan won't work. So maybe, if we try sneaking past the turrets from a different side--"
2,4,3,Glimmer,You're going about this all wrong. We're not going to win by sneaking. We gotta take the action to them!
2,4,4,Glimmer,Just let Glimmer handle this. Using my awesome powers of teleportation----I take out their first line of defense!
2,4,4,Glimmer,"Then, I teleport over the wall and take out a line of soldiers with one CRITICAL strike!"
2,4,4,Glimmer,"I back-flip, front-flip, back-flip into a teleport, poof! THEN, I take out a super-bot, and it EXPLODES!"
2,4,4,Glimmer,"And I'm past the wall----I'm unstoppable, I'M--"
2,4,4,Bow,"You ran out of teleports, like, 12 teleports ago."
2,4,4,Glimmer,"Then, I land on you!"
2,4,5,Bow,Tiny Bow! Nooooo!
2,4,5,Adora,"Glimmer, we need to come up with a plan based on reality."
2,4,5,Glimmer,"Yes, and in that moment, I really would land on Bow."
2,4,5,Adora,"Hmm. Using a limited number of teleports isn't a bad idea... So, Glimmer will take Bow--"
2,4,6,Adora,"--and, using her powers, teleport him into the turrets' blind spot. Bow shall act as backup while you and I breach the less-patrolled area up on the wall."
2,4,6,Mermista,Uh...
2,4,7,Mermista,...Why are you playing with dolls?
2,4,7,Adora,We're not playing with dolls!
2,4,7,Bow,Yeah! They're war-table battle figures--a-and I don't know if I have one for you. Hold on.
2,4,7,Glimmer,Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to be on watch?
2,4,7,Mermista,"Oh, look, the fortress is still there, like it was an hour ago. Watch complete."
2,4,7,Mermista,"Relax, I switched with Perfuma."
2,4,7,Adora,We're still coming up with a plan.
2,4,7,Mermista,Am I in the plan?
2,4,7,Adora,We're getting to--
2,4,7,Bow,"I don't have you, buuut I do have a seashell and a happy otter?"
2,4,7,Mermista,"Uhhh, googly eyes? ...Pass."
2,4,7,Bow,Wha--?!
2,4,7,Adora,Can we please get back to--
2,4,7,Mermista,I'll be She-Ra.
2,4,7,Adora,You can't be She-Ra. I'm She-Ra.
2,4,7,Mermista,"Not anymore. Ya snooze, ya lose--"
2,4,7,Mermista,"Uh, wow, rude much?"
2,4,8,Lonnie,Alert Force Captain Scorpia. We've got a princess problem.
2,4,9,Glimmer,"I admit, I got a little carried away. But the rest of my plan could work."
2,4,9,Adora,"Except that you're not taking the biggest variable into account: Catra. She's been behind every Horde plan, she led the attack on Bright Moon, she's devious--"
2,4,9,Glimmer,And I've already thought of that.
2,4,10,Glimmer,I knew destroying the bots would lure her out.
2,4,10,Other,"And so it has, Glimmer."
2,4,10,Adora,This is how you see Catra?
2,4,10,Bow,"Yeah, this seems a little off."
2,4,10,Adora,A little?
2,4,10,Other,"You fell into my trap. I've armed the tower with a bomb, capable of taking out my greatest enemy-- you."
2,4,10,Glimmer,Do you expect us to just sit here?!
2,4,10,Other,"No, princess, I expect you to di--"
2,4,10,Perfuma,I cast Giant Flytrap on Catra!
2,4,11,Perfuma,"Oops, sorry Bow."
2,4,11,Glimmer,Ugh! What are you doing here?
2,4,11,Frosta,Mermista said you were playing a battle game. We wanna join!
2,4,11,Adora,We are in the middle of a very serious planning session.
2,4,11,Perfuma,We have lots of ideas for plans!
2,4,11,Glimmer,Aren't you on watch right now?!
2,4,11,Adora,"Okay, but only if you guys are serious about the--"
2,4,11,Frosta,I'm sitting next to Glimmer!
2,4,11,Bow,What does that flytrap normally eat?
2,4,11,Frosta,"I have amazing ideas, starting with we PUNCH them!"
2,4,11,Mermista,Anyone else hungry? I am hungry.]
2,4,12,Scorpia,"Spy Bot, the mission is simple, I need you to spy on the princesses so I can stop them, and impress Catra so much she'll finally admit we're best friends, or at the very least, we have a bond that can never be broken. You got that?"
2,4,12,Lonnie,"Uh, it's not turned on, and, um, that's not how it works."
2,4,12,Scorpia,"Good, good! Yeah, I was just testing you on whether you knew how to do--that, and...you passed, so...kudos."
2,4,12,Scorpia,"Now, let's go spy!"
2,4,12,Scorpia,"Aww, aren't you the cutest little fella! Look at you with your little legs and your antenna. You're just about the cutest thing I've ever----Spying. Yes. That is the thing...that we are. Doing."
2,4,12,Scorpia,Second test...
2,4,12,Lonnie,Do you want me to drive the Spy Bot?
2,4,12,Scorpia,"Yes, please."
2,4,13,Bow,"Okay, everyone has a figure, except Perfuma who's using her plant, and Mermista who has...that for some reason."
2,4,13,Mermista,Says the guy with a bag of dolls.
2,4,13,Bow,They're war-table battle figures!
2,4,13,Adora,"Okay, so I'm thinking--"
2,4,13,Bow,"Hold on. So far I have been shot, eaten, and squashed. We're doing my plan. And there will be no death, no dying, just heroic good times."
2,4,14,Bow,"I am Bow. She-Ra's best friend, and defender of Etheria. When the evil Horde strikes, I strike back."
2,4,14,Perfuma,"Ooh, we all get hats!"
2,4,14,Mermista,Ugh...
2,4,14,Bow,"After I destroy the turrets with my trick arrows, Glimmer teleports us to the tower. There, someone waits in the shadows... ...Catra."
2,4,14,Other,Fools. I won't let you destroy my purrrfect plan.
2,4,14,Adora,What??
2,4,14,Glimmer,This is kind of amazing...
2,4,14,Bow,"It looks like I've got you meow, evil doer!"
2,4,14,Other,I'd paws to reflect on your upcoming death if I were mew.
2,4,14,Bow,"I don't know, I'm feline pretty good right now."
2,4,14,Adora,"Ooh, stop. You gotta stop."
2,4,14,Mermista,Now we're all hoping this plan kills us.
2,4,14,Other,Then purrrr-pare to meet your end!
2,4,14,Frosta,"Wait, she can do that?!"
2,4,14,Bow,"No, but I-I ran out of figures and only have this left, so she can now. ...Also, the Horde has dragons because I did not make enough robots."
2,4,14,Bow,"Not to worry, I'll shoot her with my net arrow!"
2,4,15,Bow,"Oh, come on!"
2,4,15,Adora,"She would obviously duck. You can't underestimate Catra or the Horde. ...Now, I think we can exploit a weakness in the wall--"
2,4,15,Perfuma,Is it my turn?
2,4,15,Adora,This isn't a GAME.
2,4,15,Perfuma,I use my magic to grow a Plant Golem to take down the tower!
2,4,17,Bow,"If it's made out of plants, how does it roar?"
2,4,17,Perfuma,It's plant magic!
2,4,17,Adora,"Perfuma, we're not just making up whatever we want."
2,4,17,Mermista,"Plus, your idea is dumb."
2,4,17,Perfuma,And what would you do?
2,4,17,Mermista,"Uh, I step forward and I say--"
2,4,18,Mermista,"I am Mermista. Fabulous secrets were revealed to me in the day that I held aloft my trident and said, ""For the Honor of Gray Whales!"""
2,4,18,Mermista,"Then it's like sparkle, sparkle, dolphin, sparkle."
2,4,18,Adora,Mermista...
2,4,18,Mermista,"I get shoes that are slightly better than my normal shoes, there's probably another dolphin..."
2,4,18,Adora,Mermista!
2,4,18,Mermista,"Then, like, I twirl and my hair does this thing where it looks all messy, but it's actually, like, really super-beautiful..."
2,4,18,Adora,You can't transform into She-Ra!
2,4,18,Mermista,"Uh, duh, I'm Sea-Ra. Princess of the Oceans, obviously."
2,4,18,Perfuma,"No, i-i-if-if she gets to be Sea-Ra, I get to have a Plant Golem."
2,4,18,Frosta,The Winter's Bane needs no help from a plant...
2,4,18,Adora,The what?!
2,4,19,Frosta,"My enemies know me as Frostbite Winter's Bane. My friends call me Bane. That is, if I had any. But no one comes close to the Winter's Bane!"
2,4,19,Frosta,"She's got an obsidian broadsword that enhances plus three, and her finishing move is: the Snowstrike!"
2,4,19,Mermista,What's that pink blob next to her?
2,4,19,Frosta,Her sidekick: Glimmer.
2,4,19,Glimmer,What?!
2,4,19,Adora,We're getting so far from the real plan. Can we please focus?!
2,4,19,Glimmer,Yeah. Focus on how I'm not a sidekick!
2,4,20,Lonnie,We've got visual. Turning on the audio.
2,4,20,Perfuma,My army of Plant Golems will take down the tower instantly!
2,4,20,Frosta,Frostbite uses Snowstrike to encase the tower in ice and then crack it apart...KAPOW!
2,4,20,Mermista,"Uh, you mean Sea-Ra will use the Trident of Power to blow it up."
2,4,20,Glimmer,You don't have a Trident of Power!
2,4,20,Mermista,"Bow, make me a Trident of Power."
2,4,20,Bow,I just don't wanna die again...
2,4,20,Scorpia,I can't believe it...
2,4,20,Lonnie,Me either.
2,4,20,Scorpia,"They're gonna give us frostbite, then attack us with a Plant Golem, and a woman named Sea-Ra?! And Bow's got a Trident of Power?! Who knows what that does! Oh, we're doomed!"
2,4,20,Lonnie,"Ugh, they're obviously just coming up with ideas. Terrible ideas!"
2,4,20,Scorpia,We cannot risk it.
2,4,20,Scorpia,Get in closer!
2,4,20,Lonnie,Hey! Get off of me!
2,4,21,Mermista,Maybe we should throw Bow over the wall...
2,4,21,Bow,Maybe we should throw everyone else over the wall!
2,4,21,Adora,There goes taking this seriously! ]
2,4,22,Scorpia,"Nooo! Kyle, go grab one of the other Spy Bots you packed!"
2,4,22,Kyle,"Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Was that my job?"
2,4,22,Scorpia,"Really, Kyle? I don't know how you haven't been fired."
2,4,22,Lonnie,Kyle!
2,4,22,Other,]
2,4,24,Glimmer,I teleport in--
2,4,24,Adora,And run out of teleports.
2,4,24,Perfuma,My Plant Golem tears down the wall!
2,4,24,Adora,The Horde will set it on fire.
2,4,24,Frosta,Frostbite smashes the wall!
2,4,24,Adora,The ice armor cracks as soon as you hit stone.
2,4,24,Mermista,Sea-Ra destroy's the Horde bots!
2,4,24,Adora,"There is no Sea-Ra, and you guys aren't taking Catra into account!"
2,4,24,Perfuma,"Oh, sure we are, see?"
2,4,25,Other,"I have a lot of negative things to say, and I hate flowers. >:("
2,4,25,Frosta,"No, no, she's more like--"
2,4,25,Other,I love ruining parties!
2,4,25,Other,I'm a monster!
2,4,25,Bow,What a--
2,4,25,Other,--purr-fectly evil group!
2,4,25,Adora,None of this is right!
2,4,25,Glimmer,We've been here for hours. It's time we attack!
2,4,25,Adora,"The Horde will counter whatever we throw at them. We're gonna go again, and we're not gonna leave until we have a perfect plan."
2,4,25,Bow,"...Adora, isn't this all going a little overboard? I mean, we've faced the Horde before. What's the worst that could happen?"
2,4,25,Adora,"You wanna know the worst that could happen? Fine. I'm the heaviest hitter, so Catra will separate me right away. Trap me, take my sword, do something so I'm helpless when she turns on you. She knows everything about me, exactly what I'll do, exactly how to take me out. They'll overwhelm Frosta and Mermista with bots, they'll fire on Perfuma and use her to draw Bow out into the open, pinning him down between the bots and the Horde soldiers. Glimmer will teleport in to save him, but she won't have enough magic left to get out, trapping them both. Catra will make me watch all of it before she finishes me off, and then everyone is gone, and the Horde wins the war, and Etheria crumbles, and it's all my fault!"
2,4,25,Adora,The Horde nearly destroyed Etheria. We were barely able to stop it. If this plan isn't perfect... if I'm not perfect...everyone will--
2,4,25,Glimmer,"Adora...I was captured by Shadow Weaver, taken to the Fright Zone, and lost my powers."
2,4,25,Bow,"Glimmer, not helping..."
2,4,25,Glimmer,"But you know what? We escaped. I fought without my powers...and we won! Bad things are going to happen. That's life. You can let it paralyze you...or you can roll with it. Figure out the things you can...and,  trust that your friends have your back for the rest."
2,4,25,Bow,You've got this Adora.
2,4,25,Perfuma,I cast friendship and support on my next turn.
2,4,25,Mermista,"Here. This is my Trident of Power. I want you to have it, especially since Bow is making me a new one."
2,4,25,Bow,I didn't agree to that!
2,4,25,Mermista,You will.
2,4,25,Frosta,"The Winter's Bane stands with you! Also--me--Frosta--stands with you--I--can't tell if we're still in character, or not..."
2,4,25,Adora,Thank you.
2,4,25,Bow,So...What do we do now?
2,4,25,Adora,We do what we do best: we improvise. ...For the Honor of Grayskull!
2,4,25,Adora,Let's go.
2,4,26,Lonnie,"We've added more bots to the tower's weak points. Kyle is...hiding somewhere, and Rogelio is commanding the extra turrets."
2,4,26,Scorpia,A-And if there are plant monsters or warriors in ice armor or Sea-Ra--
2,4,26,Lonnie,"For the last time, none of that stuff was real. We've reinforced our defenses. We got this."
2,4,26,Scorpia,"Okay. Good. Thanks, Lonnie. ...Who's Rogelio?"
2,4,26,Lonnie,Rogelio... The lizard guy...
2,4,26,Scorpia,"Oh, right. Yeah, I wondered what his deal was..."
2,4,26,Lonnie,"No...No, it can't be!"
2,4,26,Perfuma,For the She-Ra!
2,4,26,Scorpia,F-f-fire!
2,4,26,Perfuma,"Yay, Frosta!"
2,4,26,Frosta,This is...colder than I thought it would be. But not a problem. Snow...strike!
2,4,26,Frosta,"Thanks, Mermista."
2,4,26,Mermista,"You mean Sea-Ra, Princess of the Oceans!"
2,4,26,Adora,Charge!
2,4,26,Mermista,I am Sea-Ra!
2,4,26,Perfuma,Plant magic!
2,4,26,Frosta,The Winter's Bane!
2,4,26,Adora,"It's over, Catra. You've lost."
2,4,26,Scorpia,Catra's not here. But I'm happy to take you down for her.
2,4,26,Bow,"Whoo! Yeah, gotcha!"
2,4,26,Glimmer,Bow!
2,4,26,Adora,Catra's really not here? ...And she left you in charge?
2,4,26,Scorpia,Yes! Why do people keep acting surprised about that?
2,4,26,Scorpia,"Bup, bup, bup! You stay where you are. Or we'll find out if Sparkles here has enough magic to land on her feet. Like I was saying, Catra trusts----OW! Hey! You don't hit the person dangling you over the edge! Stop!"
2,4,26,Adora,Glimmer? Are you okay?
2,4,26,Glimmer,"How's that for improvising? Also, it's your turn now because I'm completely out of magic."
2,4,26,Scorpia,"Catra trusts--! Catra--! Catra trusts--huh?! Okay, seriously? How many of you are there? Ohhh. ...Too many. ...Whoa!"
2,4,26,Bow,That. Was. Awesome!
2,4,26,Glimmer,Good planning session.
2,4,26,Adora,"Thanks, guys."
2,4,26,Scorpia,All in favor of blaming this on Kyle?
2,4,26,Lonnie,"Oh, yeah."
2,4,26,Scorpia,"Yep. Yeah, that's unanimous. ]"
2,4,26,Kyle,"Oh, man."
2,5,0,Entrapta,"Hi, Catra! Did you have a nice nap?"
2,5,0,Catra,Why is this taking so long? You said there was a First Ones weapon here. Where is it?
2,5,0,Entrapta,"I never said ""weapon"", I said there's a piece of First Ones tech buried deep under the ice and a really powerful one at that! With the energy levels we picked up, it must have been part of the First Ones supercomputer."
2,5,0,Catra,Just...keep digging. Hordak is not going to be happy if we waste his time and come back empty-handed.
2,5,0,Entrapta,A scientist never returns empty-handed. There's always data!
2,5,0,Catra,"I'm not here freezing my tail off for data. Find me something useful, or we're packing up and heading home. This place gives me the creeps."
2,5,1,Sea Hawk,"The Dragon's Daughter Five! She cuts a fine line on the sea, does she not?"
2,5,1,Bow,"Wait, what happened to the Dragon's Daughter Four? ...Oh, oh, oh! Was it adventure?"
2,5,1,Sea Hawk,"No. Termites. I couldn't save the old girl. Anyway, I'm honored to be a part of another daring mission for the Rebellion!"
2,5,1,Adora,"Well, you know, we needed a boat to get up here, and you...have a boat."
2,5,1,Sea Hawk,"Yes, I do! Truth be told, I was...glad to have something to do. Mermista canceled our plans this week and she's hanging out with her other friends, and didn't invite me to join, I..."
2,5,1,Glimmer,"Well...let this mission distract you from all that. ...We've received reports of Horde activity from the Northern Reach. They've set up some kind of outpost, but we have no idea know why."
2,5,1,Bow,The Northern Reach is nothing but snow and ice. What could they possibly be doing?
2,5,1,Adora,"I don't know, but it can't be good."
2,5,2,Scorpia,"Okay, Scorpia, get your head in the game, alright? You've got this. You and Catra have a special bond, and deep down in her heart she knows that."
2,5,2,Catra,"Scorpia, good, you're here."
2,5,2,Scorpia,"Yes, I am."
2,5,2,Catra,"Entrapta brought all this junk from her lab. Help me find a space heater or something, since apparently, we live here now."
2,5,2,Scorpia,"So, I've been thinking, and...I know you've been really busy and focused on your career, lately, but...would you...ever want to...you know, like...hang out sometime? ...With me?"
2,5,2,Catra,What are you talking about? We are hanging out. Right now.
2,5,2,Scorpia,"Yes. Totally. Totes. But uh, what I meant was outside of office hours? You know we could I don't know, umm...play a board game or...do some other type of bonding activity?"
2,5,2,Entrapta,"Aaah, careful with that! It's a rare First Ones artifact! I've been meaning to study it, but I haven't gotten the chance yet. The last time I deployed it, it ended up infecting my robots with some kind of...murder-virus."
2,5,2,Catra,"You brought along a murder-virus, and not a blanket?"
2,5,2,Entrapta,"Oh, it does other things, too. For example, when it infected She-Ra, she lost her powers. Also, she got very floppy."
2,5,2,Catra,"A She-Ra off-switch, huh? Why didn't you say something sooner?"
2,5,2,Scorpia,"So, anyway, in non...She-Ra business, when I said we could do something--"
2,5,2,Entrapta,Uh-oh.
2,5,2,Catra,What?
2,5,2,Entrapta,"It's just a small bump. I'm sure it's fine, but...our drilling bots have gone offline. All of them. At once. ....Come on! We should go check this out."
2,5,2,Catra,I hate this place.
2,5,3,Sea Hawk,"Come to think of it, Mermista never invites me to hang out with her other friends. I mean, am I not cool enough, for them? I'm so cool. I'm Sea Hawk!"
2,5,3,Glimmer,What's wrong? Did you see something?
2,5,3,Adora,"No, I think there's something else out here."
2,5,3,Sea Hawk,"You know, they say all sorts of strange things happen in the Northern Reach. Voices in the wind. Monsters in the snow. Machines break down. Sailors disappear without a trace. We could be next! ...I am cool, right? I am. Right?"
2,5,3,Bow,My tracker pad's been on the fritz ever since that rogue communications hub messed with it. I'm having trouble pinpointing the Horde's location.
2,5,3,Sea Hawk,Worry not. We'll follow our instincts! This way!
2,5,3,Bow,"Or, there's this new signal, now. It's big. It looks like a First Ones tech signature."
2,5,3,Adora,That's where the Horde will be.
2,5,4,Entrapta,Ah! Here we go. Well...the drilling bots are gone.
2,5,4,Scorpia,What? They just disappeared into thin air?
2,5,4,Entrapta,Maybe there's scientific truth about the rumors of strange happenings in this region...
2,5,4,Catra,"We weren't sent here to chase rumors. Hordak wants tech. If your bots can't dig it out, then maybe I'll send you down there to--"
2,5,4,Adora,Catra.
2,5,4,Adora,It's been awhile.
2,5,4,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
2,5,4,Adora,You're pretty far from the front line. I guess Shadow Weaver's keeping you away from the action since you lost the Battle of Bright Moon.
2,5,4,Catra,Shadow Weaver? Wow. I always forget how clueless you are.
2,5,4,Adora,We're here to take back this land. It's time for you to go back to the Fright Zone.
2,5,4,Catra,You want us to go?! Try and make us.
2,5,4,Adora,My pleasure.
2,5,4,Sea Hawk,Adventure!
2,5,4,Scorpia,This is not how this night was supposed to go!
2,5,4,Sea Hawk,"Hey, while we're here, would you describe me as cool? Be honest, now."
2,5,4,Scorpia,Potentially!
2,5,4,Bow,Entrapta! Whatever you're doing here has to stop! You don't understand the forces you're messing with!
2,5,4,Entrapta,I know! That's the fun of it!
2,5,4,Adora,Don't move!
2,5,4,Catra,"Oh, please. You'd never have the guts. You know, as much as I love our fights, it's way too cold for this. Why don't we try something new?!"
2,5,4,Glimmer,"Catra, what did you do?!"
2,5,4,Catra,You said she'd be powerless.
2,5,4,Entrapta,She will be. Eventually. I think.
2,5,4,Catra,"Actually, this is pretty cool."
2,5,4,Glimmer,"I know you're still in there, Adora! You've got to snap out of it! Let go of the sword. You're gonna be okay, I promise!"
2,5,4,Bow,Glimmer!
2,5,4,Sea Hawk,What is happening?!
2,5,4,Catra,This is the greatest thing that's ever happened.
2,5,4,Catra,Adora! Wait!
2,5,4,Scorpia,Stay away from her!
2,5,4,Entrapta,"Oh! I get it now! The sword got infected, not Adora herself. Huh. I guess she really is organic matter."
2,5,4,Scorpia,"Catra, are you okay?!"
2,5,4,Catra,"That went so much better than I could've ever hoped. Looks like you're mine now, Adora. Come on, get her inside."
2,5,5,Bow,Is everyone okay?
2,5,5,Sea Hawk,"Well, I for one, am shocked and terrified. What happened up there?"
2,5,5,Glimmer,It's Entrapta's disc. It infected She-Ra once before. We've got to get to Catra and destroy it for good.
2,5,5,Sea Hawk,"Okay. Let's go, Glimmer. Teleport us up there. Adventure!"
2,5,5,Glimmer,"I can't. I exhausted my magic in the fight. Until I can recharge, we're climbing."
2,5,5,Sea Hawk,"Well, that's terribly inconvenient. Shouldn't you keep better count, or something?"
2,5,5,Glimmer,I hope Catra survives She-Ra so I can wipe that smirk off her face myself.
2,5,6,Catra,"Always so perfect, look at you now. You're coming back to the Horde, under my command."
2,5,6,Scorpia,"So we're, uh, keeping her...?"
2,5,6,Catra,"You saw her out there. As long as we have this sword, we have the power to make her go berserk. We can turn the Rebellion's own hero against them. That's good. I wonder which of your friends I'll have you annihilate first..."
2,5,6,Entrapta,It looks like the bots were able to pinpoint the First Ones tech before they disappeared. If you just give me a little more time.
2,5,6,Catra,"Ugh, hey. This dumb mission is over. We have what we need right here, the ultimate weapon. Pack up. We're taking her back to the Fright Zone."
2,5,6,Entrapta,But...Hordak wanted us to--
2,5,6,Catra,"Oh, wanted us to dig a useless hole for nothing? Forget it, I'm bringing She-Ra back."
2,5,6,Catra,"I'll go. It's probably just more Rebel idiots. Scorpia, keep an eye on Adora."
2,5,6,Scorpia,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I will absolutely look after this sleeping, non-moving person. Uh..."
2,5,6,Entrapta,She went that way.
2,5,7,Sea Hawk,"I'm a pirate! Pirates are the definition of cool. Although, you would think that I'd get invited to more parties...I mean, you think I'm cool, right?"
2,5,7,Sea Hawk,"I'm Sea Hawk, I am, I am / Want to take a guy for granted, then I am your man / Unappreciated in all I do, why can't they see, I'm very cool / Guys, back me up, I'm very cool!"
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Just wanted a moment alone with Catra, but, no, I'm stuck babysitting her ex-best friend."
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Uh...you okay, there, Adora?"
2,5,8,Adora,Wow. You...are a big bug.
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Whew, yep. That is the truth. Glad you're seeing clearly. Now, come on. I'm taking you back to the lab. Aw, now what was the code again? ...Uh, maybe--"
2,5,8,Scorpia,Stop that.
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Okay, wait, I'm pretty sure it was--"
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Don't, don't! Stop! Why are you making this so much harder for me? Please. Please! I'm a woman on the edge! I've had a real challenge of a day!"
2,5,8,Scorpia,How did you do that?
2,5,8,Adora,I put in Catra's favorite number.
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Ugh, I get it. You know Catra's favorite number and I don't. Rub it in my face, why don't you?"
2,5,8,Scorpia,Uh...that's not good.
2,5,8,Scorpia,"Change of plans, how about we stay inside?"
2,5,8,Adora,"Yay, it's a girl's night in!"
2,5,9,Bow,Any sign of She-Ra? Preferably the version of her that won't throw us off a cliff?
2,5,9,Glimmer,"Uh, no...no She-Ra...Just a terrifying snow monster!"
2,5,10,Scorpia,"Can't believe I'm stuck in a closet here with you. I should be by Catra's side, protecting her. Why can't you just stay out of our way?"
2,5,10,Scorpia,Catra? ...Inspector Pirate?
2,5,10,Sea Hawk,Adora! I'm here to rescue you!
2,5,10,Adora,Uh...more like I'm here to rescue you.
2,5,10,Sea Hawk,That doesn't make any sense. Is she all right?
2,5,10,Scorpia,"I don't know, but she is getting on my last nerve, and she is not going anywhere."
2,5,10,Sea Hawk,We'll see about that! En garde!
2,5,10,Adora,Aw...you guys are my best friends!
2,5,11,Catra,I really hate this place...
2,5,12,Catra,What's happening? Why is the power going out?
2,5,12,Entrapta,"Apparently, by drilling into the ice, we've unleashed these creatures and now they're obsessively trying to destroy us. What an unexpected twist!"
2,5,13,Glimmer,Where did these things come from?!
2,5,13,Bow,I'm guessing it's something to do with that giant pit Entrapta dug.
2,5,13,Glimmer,"Bow, their eyes! They're red, just like She-Ra's! Do you think...maybe the monster's have been infected, too. UGH! Catra is the worst!"
2,5,13,Bow,"Uh, think you have one teleport left?"
2,5,13,Glimmer,Hope so!
2,5,13,Entrapta,Hi!
2,5,13,Entrapta,Fascinating...
2,5,14,Sea Hawk,Hand. Her. Over!
2,5,14,Scorpia,"Let go! Catra entrusted me with watching her, I can't let her down."
2,5,14,Adora,Catra... She's mean...
2,5,14,Scorpia,"She's misunderstood! You of all people should know that! I mean, you grew up together... I can't compete with that. No matter what I do, I can't seem to break down her walls. But you two... even when you're trying to kill each other, you can tell there's a real bond there. I just... I wish she would see me as being worth her time, too."
2,5,14,Sea Hawk,I-- I know how you feel.
2,5,15,Catra,"Always great to see you, Sparkles, but we're a little busy here!"
2,5,15,Glimmer,"Where's the disc, Catra?"
2,5,15,Catra,"What, you didn't like my new, improved version of She-Ra?"
2,5,15,Bow,"Whatever the Horde is giving you, it's not worth the damage you're doing to Etheria. Those monsters outside are infected by the same virus that's infecting She-Ra!"
2,5,15,Entrapta,"Infected? That can't be right. The disc only infects First Ones tech, unless-- the bugs are First Ones tech!"
2,5,16,Sea Hawk,"I mean, just once I'd like to hang out with Mermista and her friends. I'm good at groups! I have excellent stories of derring-do! Why don't they want me around?"
2,5,16,Scorpia,"Oh, I hear ya. Catra's been so busy since she got promoted, but she still always expects me to make time for her. Does she even understand how much I do for her?!"
2,5,16,Sea Hawk,"Exactly! It seems like...the only time anyone wants to hang is when they need me to give them a ride, or do something for them."
2,5,16,Scorpia,"Ugh, tell me about it. Catra once used my rock hard exoskeleton as a nail file. I even had to buff!"
2,5,16,Scorpia,Is there...something wrong with us?
2,5,16,Adora,"You know...you guys are really great. You're just, like, the best. You're good friends, and good people. And I like you... You are so pointy!"
2,5,16,Sea Hawk,"You know what? She's right. We are really great. I'm clever, roguishly good-looking, and a top-notch sailor. I don't care if anyone else thinks I'm cool. I don't need their opinions to validate me. I'm Sea Hawk!"
2,5,16,Scorpia,"And me? I am brave, strong, give great hugs, and I'm loyal. You may have left Catra, but someday, she's gonna see that I won't. I'll always be there for her, because that's who I am!"
2,5,16,Adora,Yayyy!
2,5,16,Scorpia,And I'm also someone who's about to go kick some bug butt!
2,5,16,Sea Hawk,Let's show them what we're made of!
2,5,17,Glimmer,"We have to destroy the disc, or none of us are getting out of here!"
2,5,17,Catra,Huh. Guess I must've lost it.
2,5,17,Entrapta,"Oh, Catra, it's in your pocket, remember?"
2,5,17,Scorpia,For the Horde!
2,5,17,Sea Hawk,"I don't agree with that sentiment, but I'm also here!"
2,5,17,Adora,"Pew, pew-pew!"
2,5,17,Adora,"Heyy, I know you."
2,5,17,Glimmer,Adora! I'm so glad you're okay.
2,5,17,Scorpia,"Catra, are you all right?"
2,5,17,Catra,Just find the sword. I've got Adora!
2,5,17,Scorpia,"Oh, no you don't!"
2,5,17,Adora,Hiii....
2,5,17,Sea Hawk,En garde!
2,5,17,Glimmer,Just. Give. Us. The. Disc!
2,5,17,Catra,Are you kidding? I've got control of Adora. I am not giving that up.
2,5,17,Bow,"Catra, you have to destroy the disc. It's the only way to stop them!"
2,5,17,Scorpia,Catra!
2,5,17,Glimmer,"Scorpia, you can end this. You've got to break the disc now!"
2,5,17,Catra,Don't. You. Dare!
2,5,17,Scorpia,Uh....uh...
2,5,17,Sea Hawk,It seems to me that caring about someone is the greatest adventure of them all.
2,5,17,Scorpia,"Sorry, Wildcat. This...is for your own good."
2,5,17,Catra,NO!
2,5,17,Adora,Oh...What happened?
2,5,17,Catra,Hey! Put me down!
2,5,18,Catra,What are you so happy about? She-Ra won and we didn't get what we came for. The mission was a failure. How are we going to explain this one to Hordak?
2,5,18,Entrapta,Failure? This mission was a resounding success. Ta-daaa! I got the First Ones tech!
2,5,18,Catra,What? When did you even--How long have you had that?!
2,5,18,Entrapta,"A while. But we were having so much fun, I didn't want to say anything. Isn't it amazing? This puppy'll be able to power Hordak's portal technology and then some! Hordak is gonna be so thrilled!"
2,5,18,Catra,Hey. Thanks for getting us out of there.
2,5,18,Scorpia,Any time.
2,5,18,Catra,"All right, come on."
2,5,18,Scorpia,"Really?! Yes! Thank you! ...Oh, gosh. Look at us. Just...two peas in a pod. So when I brought it up before I said board games, but I mean, it doesn't have to be board games, we could do anything, I mean, I'm open. I-I like a-ah, bowling, ah, it's very difficult for me with my claws, but..."
2,6,0,Micah,Woah...
2,6,0,Other,"Impressive casting, Micah. But you allow yourself to become distracted."
2,6,0,Other,Oooooooh
2,6,0,Micah,You can't expect me to out-cast Light Spinner; the greatest sorceress to ever walk the halls of Mystacor.
2,6,0,Other,"I have no time for your flattery. If you're going to interrupt my lessons, you might at least apply yourself. I want focus as you cast your illusions."
2,6,0,Micah,"Light Spinner, wait."
2,6,0,Other,"What is it this time, Micah?"
2,6,0,Micah,I'm bored. I've been doing light illusions since before I can even remember.
2,6,0,Micah,"Teach me something real. I wanna levitate, and travel through mirrors, and shapeshift! You know, the cool stuff."
2,6,0,Other,"The Guild forbids third years from learning such things. You know that, Micah."
2,6,0,Micah,The Guild of Sorcerers prides itself on being out-of-touch geezers. We wouldn't want anyone to learn actual magic or anything fun.
2,6,0,Other,That's a poor likeness of Master Norwyn.
2,6,0,Micah,Then teach me shapeshifting!
2,6,0,Other,"Patience, Micah. You must start at the beginning."
2,6,1,Catra,Why do you bother? You're never getting out of this cell.
2,6,2,Catra,Lord Hordak?
2,6,2,Hordak,Why is Shadow Weaver still in the Fright Zone?
2,6,2,Catra,She's--She's my prisoner.
2,6,2,Hordak,A dangerous one. I want her banished to Beast Island at once.
2,6,2,Catra,What?
2,6,2,Catra,"Lord Hordak, Shadow Weaver is still useful to us if we can get her to talk. She knows more about Etheria than anyone else."
2,6,2,Hordak,And also about the Fright Zone. Have you considered the consequences if that information were to fall into the wrong hands?
2,6,2,Catra,"That won't happen. Without the Black Garnet, she's completely powerless. I can handle her."
2,6,2,Entrapta,"Oh, hi Catra! What are you doing here?"
2,6,2,Catra,I'm a Force Captain. What are you doing here?
2,6,2,Entrapta,"I've been integrating the First Ones' tech we got from the Northern Reach into Hordak's pre-existing portal mainframe, but it maybe slightly, completely overloaded the Fright Zone energy grid. So we're gonna have to redesign that."
2,6,2,Hordak,"What Entrapta is doing does not concern you, Force Captain."
2,6,2,Entrapta,"Oh, were you two having a meeting? Sorry, again. I guess I should be going."
2,6,2,Hordak,"No, you stay. you have two days to extract whatever information you can from your prisoner. Then you will banish her to Beast island."
2,6,2,Catra,But-
2,6,2,Hordak,Do you understand? Or do i have to make myself understood?
2,6,2,Catra,"No, Lord Hordak. I understand."
2,6,2,Hordak,Good. Dismissed.
2,6,2,Entrapta,We should be able to initiate our first test of the portal machine as soon as I rebuild the electrical grid.
2,6,4,Micah,You actually moved it. How?
2,6,4,Other,There's magic everywhere. The Princesses channel elemental magic through their Runestones.
2,6,4,Other,But sorcerers can learn to channel lesser power through spells and incantation after many years of serious study and discipline.
2,6,4,Micah,Oh.
2,6,4,Other,The Guild brings those who have a talent for magic to study here in Mystacor. But I only train the truly gifted. You're one of the most talented students I've ever seen. But you lack dedication.
2,6,4,Micah,"I'll prove it to you that I'm worthy. Here, I'll show you."
2,6,4,Other,"Not yet. First, you must promise to do exactly as I say."
2,6,4,Micah,Huh?
2,6,5,Other,Impossible.. Who else has been teaching you?
2,6,5,Micah,No one. I just did what you taught me. Did I do something wrong?
2,6,5,Other,"No. I knew you were gifted, I just didn't realize how gifted. You have incredible power! And I'm the one who will mold that power."
2,6,5,Micah,So you'll keep teaching me?
2,6,5,Other,Of course. We're going to do great things together.
2,6,5,Micah,"Yes! I mean, ahem, thank you, Light Spinner."
2,6,5,Other,The Guild needs talents like ours more than ever before. Perhaps-- No.. you're not ready.
2,6,5,Micah,"I-- I know I have a lot to learn, but I'm ready for anything. What is it?"
2,6,5,Other,Show me.
2,6,5,Micah,It's awful. Why would you conjure this?
2,6,5,Other,"It's no illusion. This is really happening. An army has invaded our lands. They call themselves the Horde. The Princesses have proved ineffective against their strength. They've accomplished much more in a short time, more than our so-called leaders have."
2,6,5,Micah,We have to do something!
2,6,5,Other,"Easy, Micah. The Sorcerers' Guild meets tomorrow to decide a course of action. I have a plan to give us the power needed to stop the Horde. I only hope that Norwyn and his followers can see the threat as clearly as you do."
2,6,5,Micah,"You'll make them see. If anyone can do it, it's you."
2,6,7,Catra,How'd you find me?
2,6,7,Scorpia,"You always come here when you're upset. Also, I looked everywhere. Now, what's troubling my bestie?"
2,6,7,Catra,I'm not your bestie.
2,6,7,Scorpia,"Oh, I don't accept any of that."
2,6,7,Catra,"Yeah, well, get used to not getting what you want in life. Hordak is making me send Shadow Weaver to Beast Island."
2,6,7,Scorpia,"Wait. Beast Island is real? Oops. That's not good. Oh, shoot. Okay, let me just fix that. Uh, Catra, can I get a hand?"
2,6,7,Scorpia,"I bet there's some nice stuff, too. Maybe Shadow Weaver will write and tell us."
2,6,7,Catra,What is wrong with you? People don't send letters from Beat Island. They go and never come back.
2,6,7,Catra,"It doesn't matter how hard I work or what I do, Hordak doesn't trust me. He never listens to me. Shadow Weaver is useful and she can help us."
2,6,7,Scorpia,Seriously/ Because she hasn't exactly given us any information.. Why do you really wanna keep her around? She's never been very nice to you. I thought you kind of hated her.
2,6,7,Catra,You-- You wouldn't understand.
2,6,8,Other,"We can no longer stand by while the Horde conquers more and more territory. The Princesses have been unable to stop them, and now they have taken a runestone, the Black Garnet."
2,6,8,Other,No.
2,6,8,Other,"No, it can't be.."
2,6,8,Other,"We may not have Runestones, but there is a way we can make ourselves strong enough to stand against the Horde. Cast the Spell of Obtainment and take power for ourselves!"
2,6,8,Other,"What you propose is forbidden, Light Spinner. The Spell of Obtainment leeches power, turning the caster into a magical parasite. If it does not kill the caster outright."
2,6,8,Other,But I've modified the spell. Tonight the three Moons of Enchantment come into alignment. This will make all the magic of Etheria stronger. Think of the good we'll do!
2,6,8,Other,There can be no good from this.
2,6,8,Other,So we do nothing?
2,6,8,Other,"The Princesses will settle the problem. Etheria will take care of itself as it has always done, without resorting to twisted spells."
2,6,8,Other,"You know I'm right. If we don't fight, if we don't become stronger, we won't have a planet to protect!"
2,6,8,Other,"Be satisfied with what you have, Light Spinner. Some power is not meant for you."
2,6,8,Other,You're all blind.
2,6,9,Micah,What did they say?
2,6,9,Other,"{continues walking without looking back] They refuse to lend me their strength to do what must be done. They never listen to me! After everything I've done, I still haven't earned their trust."
2,6,9,Other,"Norwyn and those fools don't care about magic, they just wanna hold the rest of us back."
2,6,9,Micah,Then go back and make them understand. The Horde will destroy Etheria if we don't stop them.
2,6,9,Other,"If you want to help Etheria, there is another way."
2,6,10,Catra,Pack your bags. You're going to Beast Island.
2,6,10,Catra,"Oh, that's right, heh, you don't have anything."
2,6,10,Shadow Weaver,When?
2,6,10,Catra,Don't you care? It's a death sentence. What don't you get about that? You're a goner unless you can give me a reason good enough to convince Hordak you're worth keeping around. Don't you have anything to say? Just give me something!
2,6,10,Shadow Weaver,I've given everything I have to the Horde.
2,6,10,Catra,You really are useless. You are getting what you deserve.
2,6,10,Shadow Weaver,Wait
2,6,10,Shadow Weaver,"Take pity on an old, powerless women. I know my days are here are numbered. I want to see my old Sorcerer's Guild badge one last time. It must be among my things. Bring it to me. It's the last thing I'll ever ask of you."
2,6,10,Catra,You don't get to ask things of me anymore.
2,6,11,Other,"The Spell of Obtainment is difficult. You must stay focused, though. Once we begin casting, we cannot stop."
2,6,11,Micah,Are you sure about this?
2,6,11,Other,We need this power. It's the only way to protect our people.
2,6,11,Other,Do exactly as we practiced.
2,6,11,Micah,"Light Spinner, what's happening? What is that?"
2,6,11,Other,Hold it steady. Do not stop now.
2,6,11,Micah,This-- this isn't right!
2,6,11,Other,No!
2,6,11,Micah,Light Spinner!
2,6,11,Micah,Light Spinner!
2,6,11,Other,"Micah, what is the meaning of all this?"
2,6,11,Micah,Light Spinner?
2,6,11,Other,"Micah, how could you? After everything I've taught you. The spell was working."
2,6,11,Micah,"The spell was evil. You saw what it was doing to the room, to us."
2,6,11,Other,You've always hungered after power. Bringing you into our ranks was a grave mistake.
2,6,11,Other,The only mistake was seeking the approval of a fool like you. You're all weak! None of you deserve my help.
2,6,11,Other,"The spell worked. I am stronger than all of you. [her voice grew deeper and raspy as she grew bigger, towering over Micah"
2,6,11,Micah,"Light Spinner, please, don't."
2,6,12,Other,Halt. What business do you have in the Fright Zone?
2,6,12,Other,Tell Hordak there is someone here who can help take him to victory.
2,6,13,Catra,"So, have you come up with anything to save your skin?"
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,You know I haven't.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,"Why do you insist on delivering my meals yourself? Surely, you have more important things to do."
2,6,13,Catra,I guess I just like seeing you in shackles.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,"We both know that's not the only reason. What do you want, Catra?"
2,6,13,Catra,"Why..? Why did you treat me like the way you did? Why was I never good enough? Really, I wanna know."
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,"Because you remind me of myself. You always have. Nothing was ever easy for me either. I wasn't born to power like Adora and the others. I had to earn my power, fight for it. Why should it be any different for you?"
2,6,13,Catra,"I was a child when you took me in. What could I have possibly done to deserve the way you treated me? I am nothing like you. You are old, and bitter, and weak."
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,"Ah. But you are like me. And just like me, you're losing your position with Hordak. I can see that even from my cell."
2,6,13,Catra,You don't know what you're talking about.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,You're being pushed out.
2,6,13,Catra,I am not. It's just Entrapta understands all that tech stuff.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,Come here.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,"She's earned his trust. How did you let this happen? Don't you see? I want you to go further than I did, but you need to be smarter than me. Stronger than me."
2,6,13,Catra,Then help me. Come up with something so you can stay.
2,6,13,Shadow Weaver,I will try. But I'm tired now. Come back later. Please.
2,6,14,Shadow Weaver,"Was your excursion successful, Lord Hordak?"
2,6,14,Hordak,I arrived too late. I found something but it's useless. Put it with the other infants in the infirmary.
2,6,14,Shadow Weaver,This one is different. Can't you feel it? She has power.
2,6,14,Hordak,"Fine, take it. Just get it out of here."
2,6,14,Shadow Weaver,"Oh. Oh, don't worry, little one. We're going to do great things together."
2,6,15,Shadow Weaver,It's time.
2,6,16,Catra,"Uh, okay. I know it hasn't been that long, but I figured we could brainstorm together."
2,6,16,Catra,"Come on, two devious minds such as ours are-- Huh?"
2,6,16,Catra,You were just using me all along.
2,6,17,Bow,A little to the left.
2,6,17,Adora,This good?
2,6,17,Bow,"Better. Okay, now, Glimmer, move yours more to the right."
2,6,17,Bow,My right.
2,6,17,Glimmer,Why are we.. up on the roof.. in the middle of the night again?
2,6,17,Bow,"You know how I thought my Tracker Pad had broken back in Alwyn? Well, I've been studying it, and I realized the garbled static I keep getting on my screen isn't a bug. It's picking up some kind of transmission. With these three moons in alignment, all transmissions should be stronger.. Adora, higher and more out-ish!"
2,6,17,Adora,Guys?
2,6,17,Bow,"Hold still! It's working! We did it! Guys, you gotta see this."
2,6,17,Adora,Please tell me you got the message.
2,6,17,Bow,Some of it's degraded. Can you read the rest?
2,6,17,Adora,"""Serenia. Portal. Mara."" What's a Serenia?"
2,6,17,Glimmer,"I don't know. But if it has to do with Mara, it can't be good.."
2,7,1,Bow,"Serenia, portal, Mara. Maybe Mara's last name is Serenia, or the portal is a Serenia? I'm gonna be honest with you, future Bow, I'm getting nowhere."
2,7,1,Bow,"No. Was that today? This can't be happening, not now. No, no, no."
2,7,2,Glimmer,"Adora, get up."
2,7,2,Adora,What's going on? What is it?
2,7,2,Glimmer,It's Bow. He's in trouble.
2,7,3,Glimmer,Bows tracker pad and arrows are gone. He must have left after he shot that note through my window.
2,7,3,Adora,"The not that says, “I'm fine. Don't follow me.”?"
2,7,3,Glimmer,"He's not fine. We have to follow him. If he was, he would've told us he was leaving. And after finding out the signal is about Mara –"
2,7,3,Adora,"Okay, okay, Glimmer, just clam down. I agree, okay? So, where does Bow go when he's not at Bright Moon?"
2,7,3,Glimmer,Uh...
2,7,3,Adora,"Seriously? How long have you two been friends, again?"
2,7,3,Glimmer,"Look, Bow really values his privacy. He's never talked about his past or where he came from. Never. And you know how talkative and open Bow usually is. Something's wrong. What if he's in trouble?"
2,7,3,Adora,"Bow definitely came this way, judging from the broken twigs, the sap and his incredibly distinct footprints."
2,7,3,Glimmer,"There's no way Bow would ever leave his trick arrows behind. I told you, he's in trouble."
2,7,3,Adora,What is that place?
2,7,3,Glimmer,"We have to find Bow, and get him out of this, uh... library?"
2,7,3,Adora,Have you ever heard of a library in the Whispering Woods?
2,7,3,Glimmer,"Bow, I'm so glad we found you."
2,7,3,Adora,"We're here to break you out,"
2,7,3,Bow,Shhhh
2,7,3,Adora,or fight your kidnappers. We're not exactly sure what we're – uh...
2,7,3,Glimmer,What have they done to you?
2,7,3,Adora,We got your arrows. Who are we fighting?
2,7,3,Bow,"No one. You guys shouldn't be here. You need to leave now, before –"
2,7,3,Other,Who's there? Who are these people?
2,7,3,Bow,"Play along. This is Adora and Glimmer, my friends from the academy. Adora, Glimmer, meet my dads."
2,7,3,Other,"Adora, Glimmer."
2,7,3,Lance,"Oh, we're so happy to finally meet Bow's school friends."
2,7,4,Catra,I need you to beef up security. Bring all reports directly to me. No one else. I want patrols doubled. And above all –
2,7,4,Scorpia,Uh... You were saying?
2,7,4,Catra,"Yes, and report anything suspicious directly to me."
2,7,4,Lonnie,You mean like the fact that Shadow Weaver's cell is empty?
2,7,4,Catra,I threw the prisoner into solitary last night. Not that II need to explain myself to underlings.
2,7,4,Scorpia,"Hey now Catra, Lonnie was trying to answer your--"
2,7,4,Catra,You have your orders. Next person who questions me gets to see Shadow Weaver's cell up close. Move.
2,7,4,Catra,"I said, move!"
2,7,4,Scorpia,Catra –
2,7,5,Lance,"You want anything, you just tell me, and I'll get it. You want snacks? I'll get you snacks."
2,7,5,Other,"Yes, so energetic. Heh. You girls must love attending the Academy of Historic Enterprises with Bow."
2,7,5,Glimmer,Uhh... Yes. Absolutely.
2,7,5,Adora,"Yup. Wouldn't change a thing. At the academy, that we all go to."
2,7,5,Lance,"Oh, I bet you're here to see our collection of First Ones artifacts. We got some new pottery shards. I – Oh, what was I doing?"
2,7,5,Other,Snacks.
2,7,5,Lance,"Oh, yes, yes, yes. Snacks."
2,7,5,Other,The pottery is really something. Bow's older brother sent it.
2,7,5,Glimmer,Brother?
2,7,5,Adora,"Oh, bow has an older brother? How nice."
2,7,5,Lance,"Youngest of 13, all historians just like us. And just like Bow when he graduates and takes over the library. Right Bow?"
2,7,5,Other,"Don't bother, Lance. It looks like he's not very cha-tea today."
2,7,5,Bow,"Okay, thanks for the tea and the snacks, but I think my friends would really like –"
2,7,5,Lance,"A tour of the library. Of course our Bow would find people who share his zest for history. Just wait till we show you the oldest part of our collection. A shard from an ancient, defunct runestone."
2,7,5,Other,"If it wasn't of historical value, that thing would be long gone. No need to keep a reminder of the Princesses and their war here."
2,7,5,Glimmer,But... uh... But the Horde started the war. The Princesses are fighting to save Etheria.
2,7,5,Other,"You're too young to remember the first failed Princess Alliance. I'm not. I enlisted, fought for what I thought was right."
2,7,5,Bow,"Dad, can we not –?"
2,7,5,Other,"When I came home, there was nothing left of my village but ash. I vowed then that my family would never get mixed up in fighting or the Princesses again."
2,7,5,Lance,"Well, I know what will lighten the mood, baby pictures. I've got some great ones from Bow's first bubble bath."
2,7,5,Bow,I'm gonna show Adora and Glimmer my room now!
2,7,5,Adora,I wanna see the bubble baths.
2,7,5,Bow,Now!
2,7,5,Glimmer,"Bow, what is going on?"
2,7,5,Bow,My dads don't know I'm a Rebellion fighter. They think I'm at boarding school and I'm supposed to be on break right now.
2,7,5,Glimmer,"So, this is why you never talked about your past? I thought it was because it was dark and painful for you, but your dads seem so nice and normal."
2,7,5,Bow,"Look, I love my dads, okay? I never mentioned them, because they decided when I was a little kid that I was gonna be the one to stay home and take over the library when they retire. But I wanted to travel, to fight. So, I did the only thing I could. I secretly taught myself archery, ran away, and pretended I was at a made-up boarding school."
2,7,5,Adora,"That seems really elaborate, Bow."
2,7,5,Bow,"You saw what they're like. They don't listen to me. They just assume they know what I want. And if Lance knew I didn't want to be a historian... Worse, if George knew that I'm a Rebellion soldier fighting alongside Princesses, it'd kill them."
2,7,5,Glimmer,"So, you're gonna lie to them forever?"
2,7,5,Bow,"Not forever. Just for the foreseeable future. It's worked so far. Please? For me? Besides, my dads have the biggest collection of First Ones artifacts and writings in Etheria. This is the perfect place to look for answers about She-Ra, the Mara message, Serenia, everything."
2,7,5,Adora,"Sure, why not? We can be scholars. How hard can it be?"
2,7,5,Glimmer,This is gonna be a disaster.
2,7,5,Bow,"Well, maybe with that attitude it will be. By the way, I may have said in my letters that Glimmer is a physics major, Adora's an art major, nobody is a Princess or has magical powers, and we all met freshmen year. Okay? Let's go."
2,7,6,Scorpia,"Hey, Catra. Listen, I've been looking for anything suspicious just like you said, but this is the Fright Zone, so, that's pretty much everything. I was hoping you could tell me what I'm supposed to be looking for?"
2,7,6,Catra,"If you spent more time following orders and less time questioning them, you wouldn't need me to. Now get out. Go."
2,7,6,Scorpia,"Okay, wildcat. I really didn't wanna have to do this, but you leave me no choice."
2,7,6,Catra,What are you doing?
2,7,6,Scorpia,Just let all your cares go. You're safe. You're safe here.
2,7,6,Catra,Stop it. Stop.
2,7,6,Scorpia,"Shh shh. You're safe here, okay?"
2,7,6,Catra,Let go of me. Are you crazy?
2,7,6,Scorpia,There's nothing we can't handle.
2,7,6,Catra,I lost Shadow Weaver. How are we supposed to handle that?
2,7,6,Scorpia,What?
2,7,6,Catra,Sh-Shadow Weaver escaped. I have to find her before Hordak learns the truth.
2,7,6,Scorpia,"Well, you don't have to do this alone. I'm here. And I bet Entrapta can whip up some sort of locator."
2,7,6,Catra,"No. Entrapta spends all her time with Hordak and is bad with secrets. The minute we tell Entrapta, she tells him, then it's all over for me."
2,7,6,Scorpia,"Then we make sure that doesn't happen. We'll find Shadow Weaver, the two of us, and not a word of it will leave this room."
2,7,7,Lance,This is the 1000-year-old Colonia pitcher. And this tablet dates back over two millennia. And this is where Bow played pretend as a little boy.
2,7,7,Glimmer,"Let me guess, playing pirates?"
2,7,7,Lance,"Oh, no. Bow doesn't like pirates. Playing historian, getting ready to take over the library even then. Right, Bow?"
2,7,7,Bow,Right.
2,7,7,Adora,"Mr. Bow's dad, sir, as First Ones historians, do you know anything about the lore of She-Ra?"
2,7,7,Lance,"Ah... Great question. Accurate translations are hard to come buy, but we think the name was actually, Her-Ra."
2,7,7,Adora,"Well, that's not right."
2,7,7,Bow,"But you don't know that for sure, Adora."
2,7,7,Lance,She'd fight for the power of Grayskull.
2,7,7,Adora,It's “For the Honor of Grayskull.”
2,7,7,Lance,And rode on a dragon.
2,7,7,Adora,"Wait, she got a dragon? I wish I had a –"
2,7,7,Lance,"Anyway, uh, where was I?"
2,7,7,Other,Princess nonsense.
2,7,7,Lance,"The runestone shard. It's the oldest First Ones object in our collection. But enough about us. Tell us about your studies, Adora and Glimmer."
2,7,7,Glimmer,"Uh, you know, the physics are good."
2,7,7,Adora,The history is also good.
2,7,7,Lance,Uh... I thought you were an art major?
2,7,7,Bow,"Uh, she's a double major."
2,7,7,Adora,"Uh, yes. History, art, art history, that's three. I'm a triple ma-jor. And I also teach, unless that's not a thing students do. Is it hot in here? I mean..."
2,7,7,Other,"It's really great to finally meet you, Glimmer. Gotta be honest, we thought Bow was making you up."
2,7,7,Glimmer,Really?
2,7,7,Other,"You know how Bow is: shy, quiet, not so many friends. From his letters it sounds like you really brought him out of his shell."
2,7,7,Glimmer,"Uh, yeah. I guess I did."
2,7,7,Bow,"So, for school, heh, we got this First Ones puzzle to solve. But the last word is giving us trouble. Have you ever heard of Serenia?"
2,7,7,Lance,Ooh! Serenia was the name of a mythical First Ones hero.
2,7,7,Other,Although some of us think she was a real person.
2,7,7,Lance,Umm-hmm. Some of us also think the Elberon vase dates back only one millennium.
2,7,7,Bow,Is this everything you have on Serenia?
2,7,7,Lance,"Oh, no. I'm so sorry. Ha, ha. Everything from the first floor. There's lots more on the second."
2,7,7,Glimmer,"Uhh, this is gonna take hours."
2,7,7,Lance,"Hours, days, maybe weeks. And if you're really lucky, it might take you a whole lifetime."
2,7,7,Other,Uh. You're so corny.
2,7,7,Adora,"Well, this one's just about aqueducts, so, it's mislabeled."
2,7,7,Lance,"Wait, you can read First Ones writing?"
2,7,7,Adora,"Uh, I also study linguistics. It's a fifth major or fourth major.  I'm losing count."
2,7,7,Other,What does this say?
2,7,7,Adora,"Uh, it says, “lunch”."
2,7,7,Other,"Oh, no. I thought it said love."
2,7,7,Lance,"You thought it said...? I like this girl! Actually, there's one more debate you can settle for us, Adora."
2,7,7,Adora,"I dunno. Maybe I should help with the, uh, school project. But I guess it couldn't hurt."
2,7,7,Lance,"Great. Onward, best research squad!"
2,7,7,Bow,"We're still getting nowhere. What does a mythological First Ones hero have to do with Mara? Hey, Glimmer, what's up?"
2,7,7,Glimmer,"What's up with you? You have a secret family, and you're supposed to be a historian, and you apparently hate pirates, and you never told me about any of this. I feel like I don't know you at all."
2,7,7,Bow,"Glimmer, you know everything about me, the real me. I act like someone I'm not with my family because the truth would hurt them."
2,7,7,Glimmer,"And it's making you miserable. Bow, your dads love you. I'm sure they'll love the real you, too."
2,7,7,Bow,"You don't know that. They've had a plan for me since I was a baby. But the truth is, I'm nothing like the rest of my family. I've tried to tell them, but they don't want to hear it. So, I pretend."
2,7,8,Lance,"This was found in the same dig site as the runestone shard. Thing is, we can't agree on what it is. So, what's it say?"
2,7,8,Adora,"Oh, this one's easy. This is a password to open it. It's says, “Eternia”."
2,7,8,Lance,"Ooh, ooh. It's working! It's – it's..."
2,7,8,Other,A monster.
2,7,8,Adora,It's an elemental. This'll be a piece of cake.
2,7,8,Bow,"Adora, wait!"
2,7,8,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
2,7,8,Bow,Adora is a sixth major in She-Ra?
2,7,8,Adora,"Don't worry, I got this. Ha, ha."
2,7,8,Glimmer,"Hey, leave her alone."
2,7,8,Adora,"Hold on, Glimmer. I'm coming."
2,7,8,Bow,They really get into their studies.
2,7,8,Lance,"Bow, are your friends Princesses?"
2,7,8,Other,"You are going to tell us what is happening right now, young man, or –"
2,7,8,Bow,Now we have to act before the Elemental turns on us.
2,7,8,Lance,You know what that is?
2,7,8,Bow,"We've run into them before. They only attack when they're trying to protect something. So, what is it trying to protect?"
2,7,8,Other,You've run into them before? Who are you?
2,7,8,Lance,It was found alongside the runestone shard. Could it be that?
2,7,8,Bow,"Dad, you're a genius. I promise I'll explain everything, but right now you have to trust me."
2,7,8,Other,"Bow? Bow! Bow, you get back here."
2,7,8,Lance,Never mind. Stay away! Stay away!
2,7,8,Bow,Glimmer.
2,7,8,Glimmer,Got it.
2,7,8,Glimmer,It's been really nice meeting you.
2,7,8,Bow,Can't reach.
2,7,8,Other,Bow!
2,7,8,Bow,Got it.
2,7,8,Lance,Huh?
2,7,8,Other,Huh?
2,7,8,Bow,Whoa!
2,7,8,Lance,Bow!
2,7,8,Bow,Huh?
2,7,8,Glimmer,That's my Bow.
2,7,8,Other,What is going on?
2,7,8,Bow,"I... I lied to you. There is no Academy of Historic Enterprises. I've been living at Bright Moon, fighting in the Rebellion alongside Adora and Princess Glimmer."
2,7,8,Lance,But... why?
2,7,8,Bow,"I don't wanna be a historian. I've never wanted to be a historian. I'm not a shy bookworm. I'm not a genius like you two. I make things. I'm a soldier. This is who I am. And I can't lie about it anymore, even though I know I'm breaking your hearts."
2,7,8,Other,What's breaking our hearts is the fact that you thought you had to lie about who you are.
2,7,8,Bow,"You're not mad? But I'm a fighter, and you hate fighters."
2,7,8,Other,"I could never hate you. Never. If you feel like you belong in the Rebellion, that's where you belong."
2,7,8,Lance,"Oh, Bow, why didn't you just tell us?"
2,7,8,Bow,"I tried, but you didn't listen. You only listened to me if I said what you wanted to hear."
2,7,8,Lance,"We had no idea you felt that way. We, we were just trying to encourage you to pursue your dreams. We thought we were being supportive when we really were being terrible."
2,7,8,Other,"We love you the way you are, Bow. And, we're proud of you, no matter what path you take in life."
2,7,8,Other,"This is a family hug, Princesses. You're Bow's family, too."
2,7,8,Bow,"On one of our missions, we received a message from an unknown source. If we knew what Serenia meant, I think we could figure out the rest."
2,7,8,Lance,"“Serenia, portal, Mara” Okay. But what are these other words?"
2,7,8,Adora,I don't know. It's too degraded to read.
2,7,8,Other,"Wait a second. Lance, what does this pattern look like?"
2,7,8,Lance,"Oh, I think you're right."
2,7,8,Bow,What is it?
2,7,8,Other,"Look at it, Bow. Really look at it. What do you see?"
2,7,8,Bow,"These aren't words at all, are they?"
2,7,8,Lance,"Oh, now you've got it. George, get the projector."
2,7,8,Other,"The world of the First Ones was different from ours. Climate, language, even the sky was different, filled with cosmic formations they called..."
2,7,8,Adora,Stars!
2,7,8,Lance,"The First Ones used them to navigate and named constellations after mythical heroes, including Serenia."
2,7,8,Other,The constellation Serenia would only appear in summer and only over one place.
2,7,8,Glimmer,The Crimson Waste.
2,7,8,Adora,Then that's were we have to go.
2,7,8,Lance,"What? You can't go just into the Crimson Waste. It's a no-man's-land, a giant lifeless desert. No one's ever made it that far and come back alive."
2,7,8,Other,Promise me you kids will stay away.
2,7,9,Catra,"You wanted to speak with me, Lord Hordak?"
2,7,9,Hordak,"Yes, Force Captain. I wish to touch base, as you put it. See how my orders are being carried out."
2,7,9,Catra,Everything is running smoothly.
2,7,9,Hordak,Does this mean Shadow Weaver has been transferred to Beast Island per my orders?
2,7,9,Catra,"Yes. I sent her yesterday, just like you ordered. Believe me, we're never going to see her again."
2,7,9,Other,I lost Shadow Weaver! Shadow Weaver escaped. I have to find her before Hordak learns the truth.
2,7,9,Hordak,You lied to me.
2,7,9,Catra,Wait.
2,7,9,Hordak,"I know your lax security allowed Shadow Weaver to escape. I know you've been covering it up, lying about her whereabouts. But worst of all, I gave you the chance to come clean, to prove your worth to me, to the Horde. This was a test. And you failed."
3,1,0,Shadow Weaver,Adora...
3,1,0,Adora,Shadow Weaver?
3,1,1,Angella,"Double the perimeter,
and triple it at the Moonstone. No one sleeps until we figure out how
Shadow Weaver got into the castle."
3,1,1,Castaspella,Why are we stopping here?
3,1,1,Angella,"This where we're holding the
prisoner."
3,1,1,Castaspella,This is your prison?
3,1,1,Angella,"Well, technically it's the
spare room, but it is more than adequate as a holding cell. We
removed the cushions. Most of the cushions."
3,1,1,Adora,This is the prison?
3,1,1,Angella,"Yes, it's the prison."
3,1,1,Adora,"Your Majesty, I know Shadow
Weaver. I know her tricks. I need to be there for the interrogation,
I'm the only one who –"
3,1,1,Angella,"Shadow Weaver is dangerous. I
will not let that woman near you. Near any of you. You are to stay
away from this room."
3,1,1,Adora,"But, Your Majesty --"
3,1,1,Angella,That is final.
3,1,1,Adora,"I need to get in
there. Shadow Weaver could have gone anywhere, but she came here. I
need to know why. If the queen would just listen to me –"
3,1,1,Glimmer,"Adora, maybe this is for the
best. Shadow Weaver raised you. She knows how to get in your head. We
can't risk her manipulating you."
3,1,1,Adora,"That won't happen. Fine.
I guess we should all just head back to bed, get some sleep, heh, let
the obviously unqualified Bright Moon Guards handle this."
3,1,1,Bow,"You're gonna try and sneak in,
aren't you?"
3,1,1,Adora,What? No.
3,1,1,Glimmer,No!
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,Where –? where am I?
3,1,2,Angella,"You're in the Bright Moon
prison."
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,This is a prison?
3,1,2,Angella,"Why does everyone keep –? Of
course, this is a prison."
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"You must be Glimmer's
mother. I can tell the the way your voice grows shrill when you
scream."
3,1,2,Angella,How dare you?
3,1,2,Castaspella,"Shadow Weaver. You will
answer for the crimes you committed during the time as my brother's
teacher."
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"Oh, yes. Sweet, talented
Micah."
3,1,2,Angella,You will not speak his name.
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"I'm not the one who got
him killed."
3,1,2,Angella,Tell us why you are here.
3,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"I have vital information
to defeat the Horde, but I will only speak to Adora."
3,1,3,Scorpia,"Catra! Catra, I found you."
3,1,3,Catra,"Scorpia? How did you get in
here?"
3,1,3,Scorpia,"Oh, boy. It was quite the
heist. Fright Zone guard after
she threw him"
3,1,3,Scorpia,"Very high-level, dangerous
stuff. Now come on, I'm busting you out. We don't have a lot of time
before –"
3,1,3,Catra,Before what?
3,1,3,Scorpia,"Uh... Hordak. He's called an
assembly to witness you punishment. But I'm sure it's – It's
probably nothing, but whatever it is, I won't let it happen. I'm
gonna get you out of here. Gosh, these buttons are tiny. Just so
small. Ah, hit the wrong one. Okay, just a second. Oh,
shoot, not that one."
3,1,3,Catra,"Stop it. I never stood a chance.
I did everything right. I thought I could prove myself, but it
doesn't matter what I do, I don't get to win. Shadow Weaver was
right."
3,1,3,Scorpia,"She's not right. Don't give up
yet. I can save you."
3,1,3,Catra,"You really care, don't you?"
3,1,3,Scorpia,"Of course, I care. You're
Catra. You're our leader, You're... You're my friend. You're
everything to me."
3,1,3,Catra,"Caring about people is
what got me into this mess. Get our of here, or they'll take you down
with me."
3,1,3,Scorpia,What?
3,1,3,Catra,"Are you stupid? I said, leave.
Guards!"
3,1,4,Glimmer,Adora!
3,1,4,Adora,"I'm, uh, here to relive you of your duty."
3,1,4,Adora,"Look, I told you, I just need to
talk to her."
3,1,4,Glimmer,"Ugh, Adora, Shadow Weaver will
try to hurt you again."
3,1,4,Adora,You don't know that.
3,1,4,Glimmer,"Yes, I do. She's from the
Horde. She's evil. Evil people don't change."
3,1,4,Adora,I'm from the Horde. I changed.
3,1,4,Bow,"That's different. You're not like
them. You're good, and kind, and –"
3,1,4,Adora,"And She-Ra? I was
just like the rest of them, and then I left. Not because I picked up
this Sword, but because it was the right thing to do. I have to
believe that the others can change too, even Shadow Weaver. Just –
Just trust me, okay? I'm strong enough to face her now. I need to
know if she's truly changed. If the woman who raised me still has
some good deep down inside her. Deep, deep down inside her."
3,1,4,Bow,"We trust you, but we won't let you
face her alone. Now, what do you need us to do?"
3,1,5,Castaspella,"Now for the last time,
tell us what you know."
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"I know that when you
cast a truth spell, you should make sure you've drawn it correctly.
Sloppy work. Are you sure you're Micah's sister?"
3,1,5,Angella,"She's trying to get under our
skin."
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"You could spare yourself
the trouble if you would just let me talk to Adora."
3,1,5,Angella,"No, you've put that girl
through enough. Now tell us the truth. Why did the Horde send you
here? What are you planning?"
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"You think
Hordak sent me? I escaped from Hordak and paid the price for it."
3,1,5,Angella,"You're... You're dying, aren't
you?"
3,1,5,Castaspella,"Angella, can I speak with
you for a moment? This isn't working. We've
tried everything, and her condition is growing worse. Perhaps we
should let Adora –"
3,1,5,Angella,That is not going to happen.
3,1,5,Bow,"You guys go in. I'll distract
them."
3,1,5,Angella,"We should consult with the
Princess Alliance before we go further."
3,1,5,Bow,"Your Majesties. Hey. So, who wants
to see a magic trick?"
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,Adora.
3,1,5,Glimmer,"Listen up, lady. After all
your kidnapping and mind-wiping, I am just looking for a reason to
serve up a little payback. So, if you do anything to hurt Adora –"
3,1,5,Adora,Glimmer. I've to this.
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"Look at you, my Adora."
3,1,5,Adora,"You snuck into Bright Moon. Why?
That's the only reason we're speaking."
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"To see you. You are the
only one I can trust. I've missed you, my child."
3,1,5,Adora,We're past that. Try again.
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"Clever. You always were.
From the moment I laid eyes on you, I know you were different. You
were -"
3,1,5,Adora,"Special? No. What you always
told me was that I didn't matter. I was special only as long as I
obeyed you. Why are you here?"
3,1,5,Adora,What? What's happening to you?
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"It took all of my
magical power to come to you. I am dying, Adora."
3,1,5,Adora,You're lying.
3,1,5,Glimmer,Adora. I don't think she is.
3,1,5,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull.
3,1,5,Adora,"I don't know why you're here,
but I won't let you suffer like this. I'm going to heal you, Shadow
Weaver, and then you will answer our questions. Do we have a deal?"
3,1,5,Glimmer,"Adora, you don't know how to
heal."
3,1,5,Adora,"I can figure it out. She'll die
if I don't."
3,1,5,Shadow Weaver,"Maybe I can help. I was
once a teacher of magic in Mystacor. I trained your father, Princess.
I can help you control your magic, Adora but first... you must trust
me."
3,1,5,Adora,"Fine, but in return, you trust
me. Trust that I'm not stupid. Trust that I'll see right through your
mind games. Stop lying for once and trust me with the truth."
3,1,6,Entrapta,"Hordak, great. I've got a lot
to cover with you today. I've integrated the First Ones tech from the
Northern Reach to our portal machine, but we're still missing
something. Luckily, I just picked up a signal. It's some sort of
First Ones message. I don't know what these other words are, but this
one's easy. It means “portal”. It could be the missing something
we're looking for. Where's Catra? We should send her out ASAP."
3,1,6,Hordak,"Catra is no longer a concern of
yours. She's been sent to Beast Island."
3,1,6,Entrapta,"I'm confused. As you can see
the overall productivity of the Horde has increased by 400 percent
since Catra has been you second-in-command. And look at this chart."
3,1,6,Entrapta,"The evidence shows that First
Ones tech has gotten us closer than ever to creating a working
portal. Catra has been incredibly successful at getting the new tech
for us. And this latest signal is coming for here, the Crimson Waste.
We don't have a moment to spare. We need Catra."
3,1,6,Hordak,"It is meaningless. I'm
not going to squander troops on a lifeless wasteland. This discussion
is over."
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"You are a Princess, so,
you have a Runestone. Yours dwells there, within your sword. With it,
you channel the elemental magic of Etheria. Let it flow through the
sword and into you. You must learn to concentrate. Focus your power."
3,1,7,Adora,"I've tried this
before. I can't get it to work. What do I do? Point the sword at you,
or what?"
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"Calm down. Your
frustration will cause the energy you produce to become destructive
if you're not careful. There must be peace in your mind if you are to
heal. Come closer and allow me to help you."
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"You are afraid, but
refuse to admit it. Afraid of your power, of it spiraling out of
control. Let yourself feel it, then move past it. You are
greater than your fear."
3,1,7,Glimmer,Wow.
3,1,7,Angella,What are you doing?
3,1,7,Bow,I'm sorry. I tried.
3,1,7,Glimmer,Adora!
3,1,7,Angella,"I told you both to stay out of
here."
3,1,7,Glimmer,"She's She-Ra, mom. What do you
expect me to do?"
3,1,7,Adora,"I held up my end. Now you hold
up yours. Why are you here?"
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"You want the
truth? I have nowhere left to go. Catra betrayed me. Hordak cast me
aside. I want to take them down. And helping you is the best way to
do it. Hordak has been working for years to build a machine capable
of opening a portal through the fabric of space. He intends to bring
the rest of the Horde's armies through this portal and use them to
conquer Etheria, once and for all."
3,1,7,Angella,"Armies? There's more of the
Horde?"
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"A force so large, you
cannot even comprehend it. You have struggled to hold off Hordak's
paltry troops for years. You will stand no chance against the full
might of the Horde."
3,1,7,Adora,"What makes you think he's close
to finishing this portal machine now?"
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"Because he has something
he didn't have before. A Princess who knows how to combine First Ones
technology with the Horde's machines."
3,1,7,Bow,"Entrapta. That's why she's been
after all that First Ones tech."
3,1,7,Glimmer,"How stupid do you think we
are? She knows the Horde is losing, and she's trying to scare us. 
Portals to other worlds? It's ridiculous."
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"I know how this must
sound. We on Etheria have no concept of a universe beyond our reach.
And yet, the evidence stands before us."
3,1,7,Adora,Me?
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"Hordak succeeded once
before. Years ago, he opened a portal. It was only for a moment. And
in that, a child came through. That
child was you, Adora. You were brought through a portal from another
world."
3,1,7,Adora,What?
3,1,7,Glimmer,"Leave her alone. You're lying,
we all know it. You lie about everything."
3,1,7,Shadow Weaver,"I gain nothing from
lying. Adora is different from us. Do you think just anyone could
bring a dying woman back to life? Not quite the reunion you pictured,
is it? Perhaps you would have preferred the comfort of lies."
3,1,7,Castaspella,"I think that's quite
enough."
3,1,7,Bow,"Don't listen to her, Adora."
3,1,7,Glimmer,Where are you going? Adora?
3,1,9,Adora,Light Hope. I know you're here.
3,1,9,Light Hope,"Greetings, Adora. I was not
expecting you for training today. But this shows an uptick in you
dedication."
3,1,9,Adora,"You said you've been watching me
since I was an infant. So, you must know what I really am. Where I
came from."
3,1,9,Adora,Answer me!
3,1,9,Light Hope,"It is true. You are not of
Etheria."
3,1,9,Adora,Why didn't you tell me?
3,1,9,Light Hope,"Explain. Why are you asking
about events in you own memory banks?"
3,1,9,Adora,My what?
3,1,9,Light Hope,"Why are you asking for the
clarification of events you witnessed?"
3,1,9,Adora,"I was a baby. Babies don't
remember things."
3,1,9,Light Hope,"Interesting. I shall make a
note of this."
3,1,9,Adora,"Light Hope, where did I come
from?"
3,1,9,Light Hope,"This is the portal that you came through, Adora. The Horde stole you, turned you into a
soldier for their war. I could not stop them. So, I watched and
waited for the day I could unite you with the Sword."
3,1,9,Adora,The Sword. These powers.
3,1,9,Light Hope,"The First Ones came from
beyond the stars. They made the sword so that it would only respond
to one of their own kind."
3,1,9,Adora,I'm... I'm a First One?
3,1,9,Light Hope,"You are upset. I do not
understand."
3,1,9,Adora,"Did I have a family? Could I go
back? A portal brought me here, could a portal take me... Home?"
3,1,9,Light Hope,"When Mara cut us off from
the rest of the universe, she destroyed our portal capabilities.
Attempting to open on now would have devastating consequences."
3,1,9,Adora,"Mara. She must have come from
the same place I did. Why did she do it?"
3,1,9,Light Hope,"It is irrelevant. This is
your home now. As She-Ra, you –"
3,1,9,Adora,You aren't listening to me!
3,1,9,Light Hope,"You are behaving
erratically. To bear the power of She-Ra is an honor."
3,1,9,Adora,"Don't I get a say in what
happens to me? Don't I get a choice?"
3,1,9,Light Hope,"No. This is your destiny.
You do not choose. You were chosen. Adora. Adora. Where are you
going? It is happening again."
3,1,10,Glimmer,"We shouldn't have ever let her
talk to Adora. I can't even imagine what she must be feeling."
3,1,10,Glimmer,Ah. Adora.
3,1,10,Bow,Are you okay?
3,1,10,Adora,"I'm not sure yet. But I think I
know what I have to do. My whole life, people have been hiding the
truth from me. So, I'm gonna look for answers myself. Mara started
all of this when she stranded Etheria. She's the only clue we have
about portals, and... And me. I'm going to the Crimson Waste. I'm
going to follow the message from Mara. I know it's incredibly
dangerous, but this is my choice. You don't have to come with me."
3,1,10,Glimmer,"Adora. Of course we're going
with you."
3,1,10,Bow,"You think you could get us to stay
behind if you tried?"
3,1,11,Hordak,"I want you all to watch and
learn. There is nothing I do not know. Nothing I am not willing to do
to punish those who betray my trust. Your former Force Captain has
proven to be compromised, ineffective, and worthless. To the rest of
you, take a lesson from this. This is what happens to failures."
3,1,11,Catra,You're the failure.
3,1,11,Catra,"You need me, just like
you needed Shadow Weaver, because you have no idea how to run this
place. All you know how to do is hide in your lab. Maybe that's why
you can't defeat a group of teenagers."
3,1,11,Scorpia,"Oh, Catra..."
3,1,11,Hordak,"Save you little
speech. There has been a change of plan."
3,1,11,Entrapta,"Hi, Catra. I saved your life.
You're welcome."
3,1,11,Catra,I don't understand.
3,1,11,Hordak,"Entrapta has interceded on your
behalf. You should be thanking her. Instead of the many punishments I
intended, you are being sent to retrieve First Ones tech for us –
in the Crimson Waste."
3,1,11,Catra,"The Crimson Waste? It's a total
dead zone. Nothing survives out there."
3,1,11,Hordak,Exactly.
3,2,0,Adora,"Thanks for coming with me, guys."
3,2,0,Bow,Of course.
3,2,0,Adora,And the queen is really okay with us taking off? I would've thought a mission to the Crimson Waste would've been too risky for her.
3,2,0,Glimmer,"Oh she hates this idea, which is why I didn't tell her where we were going. Besides, it's not like anyone else has a plan to stop Hordak from opening a portal. You're right. Tracking Mara's message to the source is the best lead we have."
3,2,0,Bow,"Plus, for an inhospitable desert, this place is kind of beautiful. Aw, there's even a cute little bird!"
3,2,0,Bow,"Never mind, this place is terrifying!"
3,2,0,Adora,"Okay, I know it's scary and dangerous, but if there is something to do with portals out here, we have to find it for the Rebellion. And... for me."
3,2,0,Adora,"Which way now, Bow?"
3,2,0,Bow,"Uh... So, uh, slight problem. Uh, my tracker pad, it's dead."
3,2,0,Adora,"So, we're without a map. and the plants are evil. Heh. But it's okay, we're coming from the north."
3,2,0,Adora,"And, uh, I'm something of an expert tracker, thanks to the Horde's survival skills training. We just have to keep going... that way. Problem solved! I've got this under control."
3,2,1,Entrapta,"Day 135, this could finally be it. Initiating first test. Here we go. Aha!"
3,2,1,Entrapta,Something's wrong. I'm turning it off.
3,2,1,Hordak,"No, you fool! It'll blow!"
3,2,1,Entrapta,"This doesn't make sense. It should work. The machine didn't have enough power, so we added First Ones Tech. Then it was blowing out the power grid, so we rerouted it. Now it's powered, it's functioning, but it won't activate a portal. It's like there's a key. Maybe when Catra brings that tech back from the Crimson Waste--"
3,2,1,Hordak,Catra is never coming back from that fool's errand. The machine is a failure. We're done here. Get out.
3,2,1,Entrapta,That was just our first test. If we try--
3,2,1,Hordak,"I said, we're done!"
3,2,2,Adora,"Okay, to review, the plants are evil, tech doesn't work, and sometimes, a sand dune is a pile of very angry, sand-colored snakes. So, I think we're getting the hang of this."
3,2,2,Glimmer,Why can't I just teleport us to the center of the Waste?
3,2,2,Bow,Because you don't know where it is and would run out of power before we made it.
3,2,2,Glimmer,"Oh, thank you for reminding me that my powers are limited. You think I don't know--?"
3,2,2,Adora,Glimmer!
3,2,2,Glimmer,I'm fine. Where's Adora?
3,2,2,Adora,"And quicksand. That is now on our list of things to avoid. Wow, I'm learning so much today."
3,2,2,Bow,"Adora, you know we support you all the way, but maybe we're not prepared for this."
3,2,2,Adora,We just need a little rest. I'll figure out how to build a shelter--
3,2,2,Glimmer,Or we could go there?
3,2,2,Adora,"Okay, problem solved. We'll get out of the heat, and maybe there's a map or water inside."
3,2,2,Bow,"Adora, I doubt there's anything useful here. The Crimson Waste's been abandoned for hundreds of--"
3,2,2,Adora,Just act tough. Try to blend in.
3,2,2,Glimmer,Ha.
3,2,2,Bow,"Good afternoon, fellow patrons. Except, I don't even care if you do have a good afternoon, because I'm bad."
3,2,2,Glimmer,Bow!
3,2,2,Adora,"Hi. Is this the center of the Crimson--? Excuse me? Hello? We-- Okay, that didn't work."
3,2,2,Glimmer,"Adora, I'm not so sure these are the kind of people we should be asking for help."
3,2,2,Adora,"Hello. Sorry to interrupt, uh, but we're not from around here,  and we're hoping someone would give us directions?"
3,2,2,Other,You're outsiders.
3,2,2,Adora,"Uh, yeah, I guess we are."
3,2,2,Other,We don't like outsiders here. And since the Crimson Waste didn't take care of you... we will.
3,2,2,Other,We didn't mean to disturb you.
3,2,2,Other,"There's only two rules in the Crimson Waste. One, the strong make the rules. And two, don't annoy me while I eat. I made rule one. They broke rule two. Are you all staring at something?"
3,2,2,Other,"Kids, what are you doing, asking these lowlifes for help? Don't you know you can't trust anyone in the Crimson Waste?"
3,2,2,Glimmer,"Actually, up until two minutes ago, we didn't know there was anyone in the Crimson Waste."
3,2,2,Other,"Scoundrels, criminals, outlaws, all of them. Be careful, kids. Next time, I might not be around to save you."
3,2,2,Adora,"Oh, wow. We need her."
3,2,2,Glimmer,What?
3,2,2,Adora,"Excuse me? Hi, can we join you? Great."
3,2,2,Adora,I'm Adora. This is Bow and Glimmer. And we came to--
3,2,2,Other,"Blondie, Boy, Glitter, got it. Huntara. Now what do you want?"
3,2,2,Glimmer,It's Glimmer. Princess Glimmer.
3,2,2,Huntara,"Oh, a Princess. Me too. I'm the Princess of the Crimson Waste. Can you tell? Or am I not sparkly enough for you?"
3,2,2,Adora,We're looking for something in the center of the Crimson Waste. It's important we find it. You seem like you know this place well. Can you take us?
3,2,2,Huntara,Did you not hear what I just said about trusting people?
3,2,2,Adora,"Well, yeah, but you said that while saving us. So, you can't be all bad. What do you say?"
3,2,2,Bow,Excuse us for one moment.
3,2,2,Bow,"You sure about this, Adora? All the scary people are scared of Huntara, which is not usually a great sign."
3,2,2,Glimmer,We can just ask for a map or--
3,2,2,Adora,A map won't get us past the scary plants or quicksand or whatever else is out there. We need a guide.
3,2,2,Huntara,"If I say no, you'll go out there and get yourselves killed, is that it?"
3,2,2,Glimmer,"I mean, not ideally, but yeah."
3,2,2,Huntara,"Well, looks like you've got yourselves a guide."
3,2,2,Adora,"Great! See, guys, problem solved."
3,2,3,Entrapta,"I know Hordak told me to go away, but I have some ideas for the portal machine."
3,2,3,Entrapta,"Emily, will you cut that--? Curious."
3,2,3,Entrapta,"Okay, Emily, you might have a point."
3,2,3,Entrapta,"Quietly, quietly."
3,2,3,Entrapta,Uhh.. hi.
3,2,3,Hordak,Get out. Get out right--!
3,2,4,Adora,"So, heh, for a place that's supposed to be uninhabitable, the Crimson Waste sure is habited."
3,2,4,Huntara,"The Crimson Waste takes in all sorts. They come running from the law, from their enemies, from different kingdoms."
3,2,4,Adora,From the Horde?
3,2,4,Huntara,The war will destory all those idiots caught up in it.
3,2,4,Adora,What are you running from?
3,2,4,Huntara,Huntara doesn't run from anything. You got that? I want to be here.
3,2,4,Adora,Wait.
3,2,4,Huntara,"Huh. Not bad, Blondie."
3,2,4,Adora,What can I say? I'm a fast learner.
3,2,4,Huntara,"Cocky. Heh, I like that. Give it some time, you'll do well here."
3,2,4,Adora,"No, thanks. This has been a really terrible, snake-filled day. Honestly, I don't know what we would've done without you."
3,2,4,Bow,We should say something.
3,2,4,Glimmer,"No, we are supporting her. Now, sh!"
3,2,4,Bow,You shush. Shh.
3,2,4,Glimmer,Shh!
3,2,4,Bow,No you. Quiet.
3,2,4,Glimmer,What? You!
3,2,4,Huntara,Your travel companions are loud.
3,2,4,Adora,"Hah, well, it's been a long trip from Bright Moon."
3,2,4,Huntara,Bright Moon?
3,2,4,Bow,"Listen, I know my tracker pad isn't working, but I'm sure we're going the wrong way, definitely a different way than we'd been going."
3,2,4,Adora,We wouldn't be going anywhere without Huntara. This is probably just a shortcut.
3,2,4,Huntara,We're here.
3,2,4,Glimmer,Uh.. we're where?
3,2,4,Adora,This can't be the center of the Crimson Waste. There's nothing here. There has to be something here. I was so sure! The message said-- What?
3,2,4,Glimmer,Adora!
3,2,4,Adora,For the honor of--
3,2,4,Huntara,"Paralyzing darts. But you probably figured that out, being a fast learner and all."
3,2,4,Huntara,"Outsiders are a risk to all of us. I did tell you not to trust anyone, Blondie."
3,2,5,Entrapta,Ta-da! I made you soup. Soup always makes me feel better.
3,2,5,Entrapta,"Okay, I know one big soup is probably better, but theyre so cute!"
3,2,5,Hordak,I am not discussing this.
3,2,5,Entrapta,"Your armor, it's holding you together.."
3,2,5,Hordak,It is none of your concern.
3,2,5,Entrapta,"You're from another planet. That thing in the vitrine looks like you. And you've got tech compensating for your body. As a scientist, I'm not going to stop until I figure out what's going on. Now, tell me everything!"
3,2,5,Hordak,"You want to know what I am; I am a clone! A clone of the emperor of the known universe, Horde Prime. Horde Prime cloned himself, building an army to conquer all he saw. Planets, worlds, galaxies fell before us. I was his top general, but there was a defect in my cloning, and defects are worthless to Prime. I was sent to die on the front lines, but during battle, a portal opened and sent me crashing to Etheria, stranding me here. With nothing but a broken ship, I built an empire. When my portal opens, I shall bring forth my brother's armies to crush The Rebellion, and Horde Prime will see that he was wrong. I am not a defect. I am worth something!"
3,2,5,Hordak,But the portal machine does not work. I haven't conquered the planet. I could not even clone a new body for myself. Perhaps-- Perhaps Prime was right.. I am a failure.
3,2,5,Entrapta,"Oh, no, no, no. I'm listening, I heard you. I've got an idea, but I need my tools. Be right back."
3,2,6,Glimmer,"Alright, ninth time's the charm. Everyone, hold on. One, two..."
3,2,6,Adora,"Bow, are you okay?"
3,2,6,Bow,"Luckily, everyone landing on my ribs distracts from the other bruises."
3,2,6,Glimmer,I'll get it this time. Hold on.
3,2,6,Glimmer,"Ugh, I'm sick of this! We've been tricked, robbed, temporarily paralyzed. Now we're stuck here in the middle of--"
3,2,6,Bow,Glimmer!
3,2,6,Glimmer,"I mean, I'm so glad we finally got out of there."
3,2,6,Bow,Adora?
3,2,6,Adora,"Having this mission made me feel in control. After the last few days, I really needed it. I needed answers. I thought if I found out more about Mara, I'd find out more about myself, where I came from and why."
3,2,6,Bow,"And we'll still get those answers. We're not beat yet. Sure, this road trip has been kind of a disaster."
3,2,6,Glimmer,"Pretty standard for us, honestly."
3,2,6,Bow,"But we know you're going through a lot, and we've got your back, whatever you need to do."
3,2,6,Glimmer,"Besides, it's not like you stole our weapons and left us stranded."
3,2,6,Adora,It's Huntara.
3,2,6,Glimmer,Exactly. It's Huntara's fault.
3,2,6,Adora,"No, it's Huntara."
3,2,7,Entrapta,"Oooh, this is gonna be so much fun!"
3,2,7,Hordak,I do not need your help in this.
3,2,7,Entrapta,"Everybody needs help sometimes. And you shouldn't be upset that your're not perfect--take Emily! Her programming is glitchy, the left leg sticks, and she's loud. Emily's got quirks, but that's why I like her. Imperfection is what makes scientific experimentation possible. Imperfection is beautiful. At least to me."
3,2,7,Entrapta,"Stand here! And you're really too obsessed with this whole failure thing, I mean, I'm a failure..."
3,2,7,Hordak,You are not a f--
3,2,7,Entrapta,"I don't fit in. I became friends with Adora, but she abandoned me... Then, I became friends with Catra, but she doesn't talk to me anymore... But that doesn't mean I give up. I scrounged up a few more pieces of First Ones Tech, and I can't think of a better use for it than this. Ta-da! Your armor is more of an exoskeleton now, the tech compensating for your organic body. What does it feel like?"
3,2,7,Hordak,Powerful. I...I...acknowledge the work you put into this. It is...very...technologically sound.
3,2,7,Hordak,"Uh...no matter what you say, you are not a failure. Any who discount you are utter fools!"
3,2,7,Entrapta,"Thanks. I like being friends with you, too."
3,2,8,Other,What do you think this one does?
3,2,8,Huntara,Stop messing around.
3,2,8,Other,"Come on, we're just having fun. Didn't you see the shock on those outsiders' faces? Aw, look at this. I think Huntara liked them. Are you feeling guilty?"
3,2,8,Huntara,"I did what I had to, to keep us all safe."
3,2,8,Other,"You mean keep yourself safe. You act so tough, but you're running scared from something just like the rest of us."
3,2,8,Huntara,I don't run away from anything! I am Huntara of the Crimson Waste.
3,2,8,Glimmer,"That's nice. I'm Princess Glimmer of Bright Moon, and I sparkle!"
3,2,8,Adora,That's mine.
3,2,8,Huntara,Then come and take it!
3,2,8,Huntara,That's mine.
3,2,8,Adora,Then come and take it!
3,2,8,Bow,Ha!
3,2,8,Glimmer,Quick! Time for She-Ra!
3,2,8,Huntara,Wait! You know about She-Ra?!
3,2,8,Adora,Know about She-Ra? I am She-Ra. For the Honor of Grayskull.
3,2,8,Huntara,She-Ra...is a person?
3,2,8,Adora,"Where did you hear about She-Ra? After all, it's not like it's something they teach you...in the Horde."
3,2,8,Huntara,"I was a Horde soldier. They told us we were heroes, freeing Etheria from the evil princesses. But when I saw what we were doing...how Hordak just...threw soldiers away...well. You know what we saw. You were one of us. That's where you learned to fight, isn't it? I'd recognize that training anywhere."
3,2,8,Adora,"You deserted. I did, too. And I joined the Rebellion."
3,2,8,Huntara,"Then you're a fool. One girl can't make a difference against the might of the Horde, even a tall, shiny girl like you. It's useless to try."
3,2,8,Adora,"Maybe, but I'm not alone. I won't stand by and watch people get hurt. And I won't run away. Huntara, I need your help. I need you to help us find what we came for. Together, we can all bring this war to an end--"
3,2,8,Other,You need to drop your weapons.
3,2,8,Other,"Come on, Huntara. Let's grab our loot and go."
3,2,8,Huntara,"You're right. What I saw in the Horde scared me, and I ran. But I'm not gonna run anymore. I face my problems head-on. And if you're trying to stop the war, then... then I will do what I can to help you. Now come on, we've got lots of ground to cover before we reach the ship."
3,2,8,Adora,What ship?
3,2,8,Bow,Adora...what is that?
3,2,8,Adora,It's...it's Mara's ship.
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Catra. Hey, Catra. Boy, you are just as fast on sand as everywhere else. Whoo! Ha. Now, what are we looking at?"
3,3,1,Catra,"I'm looking at the Crimson Waste. The place Hordak sent me to die. I have no idea what you're doing, as the last thing I told you was to leave me alone."
3,3,1,Scorpia,I know. It was so noble of you. You pushed me away in order to save me. And it just brought us closer together.
3,3,1,Catra,I'm not You know what? It doesn't matter. Nothing matters anymore. You know what I see here? All my hard work ignored because of one mistake. My dreams turning to dust in front of my eyes. But mainly I'm looking at that?
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Huh. Must be abandoned. According to Force Captain orientation, the Crimson Waste is completely deserted."
3,3,1,Catra,"Yeah, It better be. I'm not in the mood to deal with – people."
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Or that information could be completely wrong. Man. Maybe I should have skipped orientation, ha, ha, you know what I mean?"
3,3,1,Catra,Of course Hordak is wrong.
3,3,1,Catra,He's a shut-in who lives in his lab and doesn't know how to do anything. Why am I surprised at this? Move it. I'm tired.
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Hey, Catra, I'm not questioning you leadership here, but maybe we shouldn't pick on the heavily armed crowd?"
3,3,1,Catra,"Oh, yeah? And what are the going to do? Send me to die in the Crimson Waste? Oh, would you look at that, I'm already here."
3,3,1,Other,Good riddance to that She-Ra girl.
3,3,1,Catra,Are you kidding me?
3,3,1,Other,"If I ever see that boy or his sparkly friend, or that angry blonde one again, I swear, I'll –"
3,3,1,Catra,Which way did they go?
3,3,1,Other,Who are you?
3,3,1,Catra,"You said there was a sparkly girl, a boy with arrows, and a blonde. Which way did they go?"
3,3,1,Other,"Buzz off, Kitty Kitty."
3,3,1,Catra,"What, are you too dumb to understand a simple question? Just point, genius, and I'll figure it out."
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Hey, Catra?"
3,3,1,Catra,What?
3,3,1,Scorpia,"Last thing I remember, Hordak sent us out here to track down First Ones tech, not Adora. So, why do we need to know which way they're going?"
3,3,1,Catra,Because Adora and her friends are always after the same thing as we are. Of course they're in the middle of nowhere.
3,3,1,Other,She had the nerve –
3,3,1,Catra,"So, spit it out already! Where are they going?"
3,3,1,Other,"There are only two rules in the Crimson Waste. One, the strong make the rules."
3,3,1,Catra,"So, here's the thing. I've done this. The whole “threatening people” bit, the intimidation. I've been there. And I just don't care anymore. Some people have a bad day. I've had a bad life. If I want something, it's taken from me. If I win a fight, I lose the war. Threats only work on someone who has something to lose. But me?"
3,3,1,Catra,"I've already lost it all. And you can't be any good at this, because you just let yourself get distracted."
3,3,1,Catra,so... what'll it be?
3,3,1,Other,"Hey, you know, we don't think of you as an outsider at all. You are okay with us. We'll take you anywhere you wanna go, boss."
3,3,1,Catra,Good.
3,3,2,Adora,I can't believe I'm standing in front of Mara's ship.
3,3,2,Glimmer,How do you know this is Mara's?
3,3,2,Adora,Light Hope showed me Mara's ship crashing. Right before the stars disappeared.
3,3,2,Huntara,"I don't know who Mara is, but that's definitely the ship that says your name."
3,3,2,Adora,Wait. Says my name?
3,3,2,Huntara,Not Adora. It says She-Ra.
3,3,2,Bow,"This is incredible. A First Ones ship? This thing used to travel through space. Think of all the amazing things it contains. Or it could be empty. That's an option, too."
3,3,2,Adora,This can't be it. Where's the message coming from then?
3,3,2,Glimmer,Has this ship always been here?
3,3,2,Huntara,"The Crimson Waste got hit with the mother of all dust storms. And when it cleared, this was unearthed."
3,3,2,Bow,And then people stole everything they could pry up and take.
3,3,2,Huntara,"Look, if they didn't want things stolen, they should have bolted everything down better. Besides, no one comes here anymore."
3,3,2,Glimmer,Because there's nothing left to steal?
3,3,2,Huntara,"Well, that. And it's haunted."
3,3,2,Mara,She-Ra. Etheria. Gone.
3,3,2,Adora,Where is that voice coming from? And where's the door? This ship is massive but this room is tiny. There has to be a door around here somewhere. Hold on.
3,3,2,Mara,She-Ra. Etheria. Gone.
3,3,3,Scorpia,"Oh, boy, you really had them going. I've never seen a room of murderous toughs look so freaked out before. It was truly an honor to witness."
3,3,3,Catra,"What, those washed-up hacks? They needed to be taught what happens when they try to threaten me."
3,3,3,Scorpia,"Well, they won't be bothering us anymore, that's for sure."
3,3,3,Scorpia,"Oh, oops, sorry. Can you carry her again?"
3,3,3,Catra,"Scorpia, you don't have to ask. Carry her, idiot. Move. You know, I'm starting to thing this place gets a bad rap."
3,3,3,Scorpia,"Oh, I'm with you."
3,3,3,Scorpia,It's nice and toasty. If you look for the ground ripples you can avoid the quicksand. And my exoskeleton is loving this dry climate.
3,3,3,Catra,"And you can take whatever you want. The meaner you are, the more they listen to you. Give me your dart gun."
3,3,3,Other,"Oh! Uh... Yeah, go."
3,3,3,Catra,See?
3,3,3,Catra,I'm going to call you Kyle.
3,3,3,Other,Uh... What?
3,3,3,Catra,"Shut up and keep walking, Kyle."
3,3,3,Other,Uh... Okay.
3,3,3,Scorpia,"So, this is fun."
3,3,3,Catra,Yeah. It is.
3,3,3,Catra,Stop it right now or I take it all back.
3,3,3,Scorpia,I'm not saying anything.
3,3,3,Catra,You're doing that thing with your face where it's obvious what you're thinking.
3,3,3,Scorpia,Do you mean smiling?
3,3,3,Catra,"Look, I'm just acknowledging –"
3,3,3,Catra,"We make a good team, that's it."
3,3,3,Scorpia,Right. A good team. That's us.
3,3,3,Catra,Not anymore.
3,3,3,Scorpia,What?
3,3,3,Catra,What are you trying to pull?
3,3,3,Other,Nothing. What are you talking about?
3,3,3,Scorpia,"Catra, what's going on?"
3,3,3,Catra,I'll tell you what. Kyle here wasn't paying attention. And led us right into an ambush.
3,3,4,Glimmer,"We do this on three. One, two –"
3,3,4,Bow,Wait! ON three or after three?
3,3,4,Adora,"On three. On, two, three!"
3,3,4,Adora,Whoa!
3,3,4,Bow,Whoa.
3,3,4,Bow,This is it. This is the same message from my tracker pad.
3,3,4,Mara,"I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
3,3,4,Adora,Mara. I have so many questions for you. I don't even know where to start.
3,3,4,Mara,"I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
3,3,4,Adora,Um... Hi? I'm Adora.
3,3,4,Mara,"I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
3,3,4,Huntara,"Well, that's unsettling."
3,3,4,Adora,"No. No, no. This isn't it. I've done this before. There's usually a password or something."
3,3,4,Mara,"I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
3,3,4,Adora,Eternia. I have the sword. I am She-Ra. Administrator detected! Speak to me!
3,3,4,Mara,"I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
3,3,4,Glimmer,Adora?
3,3,4,Adora,"Of course it's on a loop. Of course it is. Because why would a hologram ever give me a straight answer? Solve a puzzle. Train. Let go. I do everything they tell me, waiting for answers, And all I'm left with is... is... Why was I taken from my family? Why was I forced to become a soldier? Why did I come here if this was nothing but another dead end?"
3,3,4,Bow,"Adora, I'm sorry. Maybe we can –"
3,3,4,Mara,"I don't have much time. I barely made it out... If you are seeing this, it means you wield the Sword. You are the new She-Ra. It means I failed. I was supposed to be the last. And I am so, so sorry."
3,3,5,Other,Oh no. It's Tung Lashor!
3,3,5,Catra,"I'm sorry, what?"
3,3,5,Other,"Look, Tung Lashor leads the number two gang in the Crimson Waste. He's bee itching to push Huntara out of years and become number one. With her gone, they'd run this place."
3,3,5,Other,"And it looks like today is our lucky, lucky day. I never thought you'd be dumb enough to step foot out here without Huntara. But here you are. And now I'm gonna leave your bones as a warning to all who cross Tung Lashor, strongest in the Crimson Waste."
3,3,5,Catra,"It sounds even stupider the second time. Seriously, Tung Lashor? Pfft. Which one of you came up with that?"
3,3,5,Scorpia,"Right? It's like, what, did you lose a bet?"
3,3,5,Other,"You done, outsider?"
3,3,5,Catra,"Are you kidding? I'm just getting started. First, all that “leaving your bones” talk, it's just too much. I'm I'm sure around here you're considered very scary."
3,3,5,Catra,"Second, they're not with Huntara anymore, they're with me. And third... I like that whip. I think I'll be taking it."
3,3,5,Other,Is that so? Big talk for such a little –
3,3,5,Scorpia,"Hey, do you even know how to use a whip?"
3,3,5,Catra,Can't be hard if this guy figured it out.
3,3,5,Other,Uh... I said –
3,3,5,Scorpia,"I think it's all in the wrist. Ya know, like wa-pow! Crack! Whip!"
3,3,5,Catra,"No, I'm not going to say 'whip' when I use the whip. No one does that."
3,3,5,Scorpia,"Ohh, maybe you can say a catchphrase then. Like, uh... Like, whip. I mean it's – I mean, I'm just spit-balling here. I like, I don't know, like..."
3,3,5,Other,"Enough! I'm gonna wipe that smirk off your face, outsider. Who's the strongest in the Crimson Waste?"
3,3,5,Other,Lashor! Lashor!
3,3,5,Other,And don't you forget it. Hah! Whip!
3,3,5,Scorpia,Catra!
3,3,5,Other,"Where's all that big talk now, Kitty?"
3,3,5,Scorpia,Catra?
3,3,5,Other,You cheating little –
3,3,5,Other,"What? Oh, no."
3,3,5,Catra,"Oh, hold on. Great. Thanks for the whip."
3,3,5,Other,"Guys. Anybody! Help me, please!"
3,3,5,Catra,"That was too easy. Now, who's the strongest in the Crimson Waste?"
3,3,5,Scorpia,Catra. Catra. Catra.
3,3,5,Other,Catra!
3,3,5,Catra,And don't you forget it.
3,3,5,Other,yeah!
3,3,6,Mara,"I don't know what they told you, but it wasn't all bad at first. We were the first ones to settle Etheria, to really study this planet's magic. How could it go so wrong? Light Hope use the-- Can't-- Weapon-- The weapon-- Weapon--"
3,3,6,Adora,"What weapon? Bow, how's it going? Have you fixed it?"
3,3,6,Bow,"I'm trying, but I think the message got damaged when the ship crashed."
3,3,6,Mara,"I opened a portal to a completely empty dimension and pulled Etheria in. I hid us from the rest of the universe to keep everyone safe. This is the one place they'll never find us. I saw what they would do. The deaths that would follow. I couldn't stop them before, but I can now. Hiding is our only option. Maybe it's been a week. Maybe it's been thousands of years. I never wanted to be a hero. I won't be remembered as one."
3,3,6,Mara,"You have the Sword now. It is the Administrator Key to our planet. With it, you can activate a portal. So I'm begging you. Don't do it. Leave us here. If you open a portal, death and destruction will follow. For the good of the universe, Etheria must stay in Despondos. If not, everyone will –"
3,3,6,Huntara,Who's there? Come out and face Huntara!
3,3,6,Huntara,You two joined Tung Lashor?
3,3,6,Catra,They haven't joined him. They joined me. Hey Adora.
3,3,6,Adora,For the honor of--
3,3,6,Catra,"This might be the quickest I've ever won a fight. Always so dramatic with you, isn't it, Adora?"
3,3,6,Adora,Huntara! Get them out!
3,3,6,Catra,Stop her.
3,3,6,Other,A toast to driving Huntara out of the Waste!
3,3,6,Other,"A toast to finding all this new loot, huh?"
3,3,6,Other,"And a toast to Boss Catra, best leader we've ever had!"
3,3,6,Other,Yeah!
3,3,6,Catra,Scorpia! A toast to Scorpia!
3,3,6,Other,"Oh, yes, Scorpia! Whoo!"
3,3,6,Scorpia,"What? I can't. You guys, I – Thank you. Yes. Gosh."
3,3,6,Catra,"Can you believe this? They said this was called a “party”. I like it. When we go back, there's going to be a lot more parties."
3,3,6,Scorpia,"Uh, the crazy desert lady got away."
3,3,6,Catra,"Let her. We've got the most important thing right here. You heard that hologram. This is the key to the whole planet. When I bring this back to the Fright Zone, Hordak will see me for what I'm worth and I'll be back on top."
3,3,6,Scorpia,"Or, you know, counterpoint, we don't go back at all."
3,3,6,Catra,What? Why wouldn't we go back?
3,3,6,Scorpia,Uh... Because you hate it there?
3,3,6,Catra,I don't.
3,3,6,Scorpia,"Hear me out, okay? Within like, a day, you've defeated the gangs ruling the Crimson Waste and made yourself their leader. This is the happiest I've ever seen you. Scratch that. This is the first time I've ever seen you happy, period. So, why would we go back? Let's stay here. Forget Hordak. Forget Adora. Forget all of them. We could rule the Crimson Waste together, just the two of us. We could, you know, be happy."
3,3,6,Catra,I-- I don't – I have to go check on the prisoner.
3,3,6,Adora,"Catra, you can't do this."
3,3,6,Catra,"Well, hello to you, too. What can't I do this time?"
3,3,6,Adora,Hordak is trying to open a portal. He wants to bring the rest of the Horde army through to Etheria. We can't let that happen.
3,3,6,Catra,The rest of the Horde army?
3,3,6,Adora,Hordak is part of a gigantic evil army from another world--
3,3,6,Catra,Never a dull moment with you. Why would I be against more Horde? That means we win and you lose.
3,3,6,Adora,We'll all lose if Hordak uses his portal machine. Light Hope and Mara both said that opening a portal will endanger everyone.
3,3,6,Catra,"You'll listen to anything weird old holograms tell you, won't you? You should really try to get over that. Besides, how do you know about what Hordak's doing?"
3,3,6,Adora,Shadow Weaver told me. We know all about Hordak's plan.
3,3,6,Catra,Shadow Weaver told you? How exactly did Shadow Weaver tell you this?
3,3,6,Adora,You didn't know?
3,3,6,Catra,How?
3,3,6,Adora,"Catra, Shadow Weaver is in Bright Moon."
3,3,6,Catra,Shadow Weaver left me for you. All of this happened because of you.
3,3,6,Adora,"Catra? Catra, please, you have to listen."
3,3,6,Scorpia,"Hey Catra. Whoa, there. Gotta be careful, boss."
3,3,6,Scorpia,Catra? You okay?
3,3,6,Catra,We are going back.
3,3,6,Catra,We are going to open a portal. And we are going to crush them all.
3,4,1,Glimmer,"Oh, you're already here. Perfect."
3,4,1,Mermista,Yeah. Where have you been? Is this some new She-Ra form?
3,4,1,Glimmer,No. this is Huntara. She's the leader of the Crimson Waste. Or was. We don't have time to get into it. We need to get to the Fright Zone.
3,4,1,Angella,The world doesn't stop just because you aren't here. We have been planning our attack on the Horde.
3,4,1,Bow,"Ohh. That's a relief, because Catra kidnapped Adora."
3,4,1,Angella,The Horde has Adora?
3,4,1,Glimmer,Which also means they can open a portal because they have her sword.
3,4,1,Angella,What? I don't understand.
3,4,1,Glimmer,There's no time to waste.
3,4,1,Angella,"Glimmer, slow down."
3,4,1,Glimmer,We need to go to the Fright Zone now.
3,4,1,Angella,"We? You are not going anywhere until you explain. Glimmer, outside. Now."
3,4,1,Entrapta,This suit may be my best work yet.
3,4,1,Entrapta,No reason to get in a tizzy.
3,4,1,Hordak,I have never been in a tizzy.
3,4,1,Entrapta,"you can't expect everything to work perfectly overnight. Like our machine. We still haven't figured out the missing piece that'll let us cut through the planetary interference. If we try now, the portal might not be stable long enough to get anyone through."
3,4,1,Hordak,"We only need to open a portal for a short time. Long enough to send a signal through to Horde Prime. Once he receives it, he should have not trouble opening a portal form his side."
3,4,1,Entrapta,And then you'll have to go with them. But there's still so much data we could collect. What's the rush? We'll just keep working on it until it's perfect.
3,4,1,Catra,What? Heh. Didn't expect to see me again?
3,4,1,Entrapta,"Oh, you have a whip now?"
3,4,1,Catra,Focus. I got what you needed. This sword is the key to the whole planet.
3,4,1,Entrapta,"I suppose it makes sense. She-Ra's sword is First Ones tech, maybe the most powerful I've ever seen. All this time, this was the key that we needed. I guess I should figure out how it works."
3,4,1,Catra,I brought you everything you need to open a portal and finish the Princesses off for good. What are we waiting for?
3,4,1,Hordak,Hmmm.
3,4,2,Glimmer,We're wasting too much time. We need to act. The Horde has Adora and the Sword.
3,4,2,Angella,And then what? How are you going to get in? You have no plan. We are not rushing in. I won't lose anyone else.
3,4,2,Glimmer,Before I started “rushing in” the Rebellion hadn't made a move in years. You need me.
3,4,2,Angella,"I need you to be a leader, and that means not running off whenever you feel like it."
3,4,2,Glimmer,"What's the point? You'll always be around, telling me what I can't do."
3,4,2,Angella,"You never listen. I try and try to reach you, to trust you."
3,4,2,Glimmer,You wanna talk about trust? How come you never told me that Shadow Weaver was Dad's old teacher?
3,4,2,Angella,I... It was a long time ago.
3,4,2,Glimmer,You know what? We should be talking to her. She knows the Horde.
3,4,2,Angella,She can't be trusted.
3,4,2,Glimmer,We have to do something. You would see that if you weren't totally paralyzed by fear.
3,4,2,Angella,"I am you queen, and I say we cannot afford to lose anyone else. Either come up with a reasonable plan, Commander Glimmer, or stay out of the way."
3,4,2,Bow,Uh...
3,4,3,Entrapta,"With the sword connected to the portal machine, we should finally be able to bypass the planetary interference. I just have no idea how it works. Heh."
3,4,3,Hordak,Must she be here?
3,4,3,Entrapta,"Good question. I'm not sure if we just need the sword or of we need She-Ra, too. Adora, you wouldn't happen to know, would you?"
3,4,3,Adora,"No. Even if I did, I wouldn't tell the Horde."
3,4,3,Entrapta,That's okay. I like figuring stuff out.
3,4,3,Adora,"Please, Entrapta, you don't wanna do this."
3,4,3,Hordak,"Silence! Entrapta, begin."
3,4,3,Adora,"You. You took me away from my family when I was a baby. You lied to me my whole life, about the Princesses, about Etheria, about who I am."
3,4,3,Hordak,I could not have lied to you about who you are. Because I have never known nor cared about someone as inconsequential as you.
3,4,3,Adora,"You should care, because I'm the one who's gonna make sure you fail."
3,4,3,Hordak,I will not fail. You have no power to stop me. I am opening that portal. And I am going to use your own sword to wipe out the rest of you pathetic Rebellion once and for –
3,4,3,Entrapta,Oh.
3,4,3,Hordak,Get it to work.
3,4,3,Entrapta,Woah. Wow.
3,4,4,Bow,This is a bad idea.
3,4,4,Glimmer,"It's a great idea. Okay, it's terrible. But what choice do we have?"
3,4,4,Bow,"I wanna help as much as you do, but Shadow Weaver?"
3,4,4,Glimmer,Adora needs us now. And Shadow Weaver would know all about the Fright Zone's weak points. Lets at least talk to her.
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,Princess. It's about time.
3,4,4,Glimmer,You knew we were coming?
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,"Him, I had no idea about. But you... You are smart, you want to stop the Horde, and you know I'm the only one who can help you do that. I must admit, I thought it would take you longer to speak with me."
3,4,4,Glimmer,"Catra kidnapped Adora in the Crimson Waste. We need to get her back, before the Horde uses her and her sword to open a portal."
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,"His machine is complete? And they have Adora? We must hurry. If Hordak has the opportunity to open a portal, he will do so immediately. The Alliance will never get there in time – but perhaps..."
3,4,4,Glimmer,What? What is it?
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,Let me out and I can help you teleport right into the heart of the Fright Zone.
3,4,4,Glimmer,Me? I couldn't even get to the edge of the Fright Zone without running out of power. I'm nowhere near strong enough.
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,"But I can make you stronger. I'm still the only sorceress who has ever been able to tap into a runestone. If you allow me to access your connection to the Moonstone, I can enhance your powers. You could teleport us all the way there."
3,4,4,Bow,"Uh, us?"
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,"I suppose you could come. We'll teleport directly into Hordak's sanctum, disable the portal machine, and find Adora."
3,4,4,Glimmer,You can really make me that powerful?
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,"You think of yourself only as a Princess, but you're the child of a great sorcerer. You have a more powerful connection to magic than you've ever realized. Let me show you."
3,4,4,Bow,You just wanna use Glimmer's power to escape.
3,4,4,Shadow Weaver,I want to destroy Hordak. We must strike now. Hordak can't be allowed to open a portal. We'll never have another opportunity. You know that.
3,4,5,Other,"Hey, would you look at this?"
3,4,5,Scorpia,You can't take that.
3,4,5,Other,"Ha, ha. Let's make this thing official."
3,4,5,Scorpia,It doesn't even fit.
3,4,5,Other,Not bad. You look good in a uniform.
3,4,5,Scorpia,"Catra. Catra, there you are. Uhh, I have been looking everywhere for you."
3,4,5,Catra,"Yeah, well, I've kinda had my hands full. Any minute now, Hordak's going to open a portal and I'll be the reason the Horde defeats the Princesses. But hey, I couldn't have done any of it without you. Thanks."
3,4,6,Entrapta,"You're right. Just look away. Ohh, I can't. What's taking Hordak so long?"
3,4,6,Adora,Entrapta... we never meant to leave you behind. We thought you were dead.
3,4,6,Entrapta,But Catra said you abandoned me.
3,4,6,Adora,Catra would say anything that helps her get what she wants.
3,4,6,Entrapta,"Catra is my friend. I think. Yes, the data says she is."
3,4,6,Adora,"Look, I understand. Catra was my friend, too. But she makes bad decisions. This is one of them. The Horde's armies will come through, and then it's all over for Etheria. You can't open a portal."
3,4,6,Entrapta,"Oh, but I can. Did you miss the whole sword makes the portal machine work thing? I really don't have time to explain it."
3,4,6,Adora,It's too dangerous.
3,4,6,Entrapta,"All exploration has an element of danger. But think of what we could find. Whole worlds, galaxies, things we can't even imagine."
3,4,6,Adora,"Entrapta, please listen. It isn't going to work. The last She-Ra made it so we could never open another portal. Trying could destroy everything."
3,4,6,Entrapta,"I have noticed some anomalies in my portal trials. They could potentially pose a problem. Maybe I should run more tests. You won't try to escape if I just pop out for a quick sec, will you?"
3,4,6,Adora,Uh... No?
3,4,6,Entrapta,"Okay, great, really appreciate it. Come on, Emily."
3,4,7,Mermista,What do you think you're doing?
3,4,7,Glimmer,"Please, don't try to stop us. This is the only way to save Adora."
3,4,7,Perfuma,We're not trying to stop you. We wanna come with you.
3,4,7,Mermista,"Look, we could do the whole “You can't come with us, it's too risky” thing."
3,4,7,Frosta,Or you could just accept that we're coming. Because we are.
3,4,7,Shadow Weaver,A larger group will be a disadvantage. I won't –
3,4,7,Mermista,"You will. We're calling the shots here. You're gonna have to make that thing bigger, weird scary lady."
3,4,8,Angella,Glimmer?
3,4,9,Shadow Weaver,Quickly now.
3,4,11,Angella,No!
3,4,12,Glimmer,"We did it. I did it. Oh, that was amazing."
3,4,12,Bow,"Hmm, kind of figured Hordak's sanctum would be way scarier and not so empty."
3,4,12,Mermista,"Yeah, no, decorating is not their strongest suit."
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,"We aimed for Hordak's sanctum, but obviously we missed. We're not far. Stay behind me. And try to be quiet."
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,We have to go.
3,4,12,Perfuma,I'll hold her off.
3,4,12,Mermista,My turn. I didn't almost drown in these sewers for nothing.
3,4,12,Frosta,I want in.
3,4,12,Mermista,We'll keep them busy. Go.
3,4,12,Catra,"Lonnie, why did you pull –? Shadow Weaver?"
3,4,12,Catra,"I heard you were with the enemy, but are you actually holding hands with a Princess right now?"
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,"There's no sense in trying to fight us. You don't stand a chance. Join us, or stand aside."
3,4,12,Catra,Ahh!
3,4,12,Glimmer,Bow!
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,Don't lose your focus. Concentrate.
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,"Catra, there's no need for us to be enemies. I can help you. I can offer you a way out."
3,4,12,Catra,"So, what? You're on the side of good now? You made me this way, and you get to be the good guy? Do you know what happened to me after you escaped? Do you even care? You couldn't wait for to get away from here, from me. But you came back for Adora."
3,4,12,Shadow Weaver,I came back to stop Hordak. I will make sure he's destroyed. Don't make me destroy you too.
3,4,12,Catra,"Oh, I'm going to make sure we win. We're going to open that portal, and then there will be nothing left of you or the Princesses."
3,4,12,Bow,Stop it. You're taking too much.
3,4,12,Other,"No. You can't fight them, they're too strong."
3,4,13,Scorpia,"Ah, boy, I really appreciate you letting me assist you. I miss hanging out. Yeah, you've been so busy with Hordak lately and Catra – I mean, she's got her new friends."
3,4,13,Entrapta,"Oh, this is not good."
3,4,13,Scorpia,"Oh, you want me to go, too? I understand. I'm probably in your way. I'll just –"
3,4,13,Entrapta,"No, no that. I've been running diagnostics on the portal. Watch."
3,4,13,Scorpia,"You are right. That is not good. Is that gonna happen? I mean, to the actual planet?"
3,4,13,Entrapta,"This is just an illustration. What will actually happen will be much worse. If my numbers are right, and they are, if we open a portal, the anomalies will be catastrophic. It'll unhinge time and space, creating a warped reality that will collapse in on itself, erasing us from existence. I never thought I'd say this, but we can't go through with it."
3,4,13,Scorpia,Catra.
3,4,13,Catra,Why aren't you in Hordak's lab?
3,4,13,Entrapta,"Uh, mm..."
3,4,13,Catra,There's no time. We need to fire up the portal machine.
3,4,13,Entrapta,We can't. Opening a portal now will be disastrous. It's going to collapse and take us all with it. Adora was right.
3,4,13,Catra,"Adora is right. Adora gets everything she wants. But not this time. This time, I am going to win. I don't care what it takes. We are opening that portal now."
3,4,13,Entrapta,No! I won't! I need to tell Hordak. He'll understand –
3,4,13,Catra,Get her out of here.
3,4,13,Other,What do you want me to do with her?
3,4,13,Catra,I don't care. Just get rid of her. Put her on the transport to Beast Island.
3,4,13,Scorpia,B-Beast Island? You can't.
3,4,13,Catra,You want to be next?
3,4,14,Bow,"Glimmer, no."
3,4,14,Glimmer,There's no choice. Do it.
3,4,15,Hordak,"Ohh, she did it."
3,4,15,Catra,"The Princesses are here. There's no time to waste, we need to open the portal."
3,4,15,Hordak,Where's Entrapta? I need her.
3,4,15,Catra,Who do you think let the Princesses in?
3,4,15,Hordak,But she... she wouldn't.
3,4,15,Catra,Did you really think she was on our side?
3,4,15,Catra,"Oh, you can't trust anyone, especially a Princess. They'll just use you to get what they want. Open the portal and let's end this."
3,4,15,Bow,This way.
3,4,15,Adora,Bow!
3,4,15,Catra,Forget about them. Pull the switch.
3,4,15,Adora,"Catra, please, don't."
3,4,15,Adora,No!
3,5,0,Catra,Pull the switch! And let's end this.
3,5,0,Adora,"Catra… Please, don't. No!"
3,5,0,Catra,Adora…
3,5,1,Catra,Adora!
3,5,1,Catra,"Whoa, whoa, whoa! A-Adora! Heh. Since when do you sleep in?"
3,5,1,Adora,Where am I? How did I get here?
3,5,1,Catra,"Uh, you're in your room. Are you okay?"
3,5,1,Adora,I… I'm fine. I was just having a weird dream. There was something I needed to fix…
3,5,1,Catra,"Of course you dream about work. There's nothing to fix, Adora. Everything's perfect."
3,5,1,Adora,Yeah…it was just a dream.
3,5,1,Catra,"Come on, get up."
3,5,1,Catra,Adora…
3,5,2,Other,Adora… It's really her! It's Adora!
3,5,2,Other,Whoo! Yeah! All right! Yes!
3,5,2,Adora,What are they all looking at?
3,5,2,Catra,You! The invasion of Thaymor went perfectly. You're the hero of the hour.
3,5,2,Adora,Thaymor…
3,5,2,Adora,Oh…Yeah! I defeated the rebel insurgents at Thaymor. Yeah. I did that.
3,5,2,Catra,"Oh, please, you couldn't have done it without me."
3,5,2,Adora,Right… What would I ever do without you?
3,5,2,Other,"Hey. Watch where you're going, twerp. Force Captain! I didn't know you were-- I'm so sorry."
3,5,2,Adora,You'd better be. Dismissed.
3,5,2,Catra,Oh! Force Captain! Don't hurt me!
3,5,2,Catra,Too good!
3,5,2,Adora,Where are we going again?
3,5,2,Catra,To the locker room. There's something I wanna show you.
3,5,2,Adora,Then why are we going the long way around? Let's take the side door right—Huh.
3,5,2,Catra,What? It's always been this way. Are you sure you're okay?
3,5,2,Adora,"Yeah, I'm okay."
3,5,2,Catra,"Do you have a concussion or something? I know you get hit on the head a lot, but I figured your dumb little hair poof would cushion the blow."
3,5,2,Adora,"I'm fine, okay? Don't make me kick your butt!"
3,5,2,Catra,"Pfft, as if you could."
3,5,3,Lonnie,Surprise!
3,5,3,Kyle,Surprise.
3,5,3,Adora,What is this? Are those ration bars?
3,5,3,Lonnie,"We wouldn't have been able to defeat the rebels at Thaymor without you. Plus, you were the one who talked Shadow Weaver into letting us come. So, we all pitched in, took Kyle's ration bars for a week, and made this."
3,5,3,Kyle,"I'm hungry, but celebrating your victory is worth it."
3,5,3,Adora,"You guys! You even got the gray kind, it's way better than the brown kind."
3,5,3,Lonnie,"Hey, it was Catra's idea!"
3,5,3,Adora,"Oh, yeah?"
3,5,3,Catra,"Eh, whatever, don't make a big deal about it."
3,5,3,Adora,"Wow, I can't believe you like me, that is so embarrassing for you."
3,5,3,Catra,"Ow! Ugh, stop it! Get off! This is not because I like you!"
3,5,3,Kyle,"No. No, no, no!"
3,5,3,Lonnie,"Oh, come on, Kyle!"
3,5,3,Kyle,Sorry…
3,5,3,Kyle,Dang it…
3,5,3,Adora,What?
3,5,3,Catra,Hang on. You got something riiiiight…there!
3,5,3,Shadow Weaver,Adora.
3,5,3,Shadow Weaver,Get off the floor. You are the Force Captain who sacked Thaymor.
3,5,3,Adora,"Sorry, Shadow Weaver."
3,5,3,Shadow Weaver,And you…
3,5,3,Shadow Weaver,Look at you. You're a mess. Go get yourself cleaned up.
3,5,3,Catra,"Yes, Shadow Weaver."
3,5,3,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, come with me."
3,5,4,Shadow Weaver,"I will admit, I did not think that Catra and the others were ready to be deployed. But under your command, they performed admirably. You are becoming every bit the leader I always knew you to be."
3,5,4,Adora,"Thank you, Shadow Weaver. I couldn't have done it without them."
3,5,4,Shadow Weaver,"Suffice it to say, Hordak is impressed with your performance. He is rewarding you with a new mission."
3,5,4,Adora,Really?
3,5,4,Shadow Weaver,"You'll get the rest of the details at briefing. Look at it, Adora. This is who you are. The Force Captain who will lead the Horde to victory."
3,5,4,Shadow Weaver,It's what you've always dreamed of. Everything is perfect.
3,5,4,Razz,"Mara, dearie!"
3,5,4,Adora,What did you just say?
3,5,4,Shadow Weaver,"I said, are you ready for the briefing, Adora? Now run along. Don't keep the sergeant waiting."
3,5,5,Scorpia,Hi. I'm Scorpia.
3,5,5,Adora,"Oh, hey. Adora."
3,5,5,Scorpia,"You know, I don't know what it is, but I do not like you. I-It's just like this gut feeling I have. Maybe it's that little poof thing you do with your hair. Or how much it draws attention to your gigantic forehead."
3,5,5,Adora,"Okay, can everyone lay off my hair today?"
3,5,5,Scorpia,"And what kind of name is “Adora”, anyway? It's like, okay, I get it, everyone loves you. But I do not."
3,5,5,Other,"Welcome, Force Captains. After the perfect execution of our mission in Thaymor, the Horde is now in a better position than ever to take the rest of Etheria. And here's our next target: The Salineas Sea Gate, separating Horde Territory from rebel controlled waters… We have a week to plan, and then it's go-time, people."
3,5,5,Other,"Now, it's possible that you might have to go face-to-face with a Princess. They're powerful and completely devoid of conscience. But it's possible to take them out."
3,5,5,Razz,What happened to the stars?
3,5,5,Adora,What's going on?!
3,5,5,Other,"Uh, Force Captain Adora? You have something to say?"
3,5,5,Adora,Huh? Where's the screen?
3,5,5,Other,There's…no screen. All the information should be in your report.
3,5,5,Other,Force Captain!
3,5,6,Catra,Adora? Adora! What is wrong?
3,5,6,Adora,Did you write this?
3,5,6,Catra,Did I write a blank piece of paper? I'm gonna go with no.
3,5,6,Adora,"No, there was something—Something there, I—I think. And then I was running. Why was I running?"
3,5,6,Catra,"Okay, okay, calm down."
3,5,6,Adora,"I can't calm down. There's something I keep forgetting, there's something I-I'm supposed to fix. I remember a sword, a b-bright light, and you were there—"
3,5,6,Adora,Ow! What was that?
3,5,6,Catra,Sorry! You were freaking out and it was freaking me out!
3,5,6,Adora,"Well, you didn't have to slap me!"
3,5,6,Catra,"Come on, let's get you outside, you need some air."
3,5,6,Adora,"No, Catra, I don't need—"
3,5,7,Adora,--Air… How did we get here?
3,5,7,Catra,We climbed up…like we always do. Don't you remember?
3,5,7,Adora,I don't know what's happening to me. It's like I'm losing my mind.
3,5,7,Catra,You just need to relax.
3,5,7,Adora,"Yeah… Yeah, you're probably right. I'm--I'm fine. Everything's fine."
3,5,7,Catra,"Of course I'm right. Everything's perfect. Soon, the two of us are gonna be ruling Etheria together, just like we always planned."
3,5,7,Adora,Is that what you really want? To rule the world?
3,5,7,Catra,"I—I mean, yeah, obviously… Isn't that what you want, too?"
3,5,7,Adora,I don't know.
3,5,7,Catra,Don't flake out on me now. This is what we always wanted. Everything will be perfect as long as we stay together.
3,5,7,Adora,What if we don't stay together? What if it all goes wrong?
3,5,7,Adora,Why can't you see that?!
3,5,7,Catra,"Adora! Stay with me, okay? You're just seeing things. It's all in your head."
3,5,7,Lonnie,Adora! Catra! Thought we'd find you up there. Get down here! We got big news.
3,5,7,Adora,…What?
3,5,7,Lonnie,"Okay, okay. We just got word, we're being sent to Salineas tonight."
3,5,7,Adora,But they said at the briefing that's not for another week.
3,5,7,Lonnie,Adora? It's been a week.
3,5,7,Adora,No.
3,5,7,Catra,Adora?
3,5,7,Adora,"I know this is wrong, can't you see it?! My memories don't match, we're jumping around, things are disappearing, it's like time and space aren't working right. And I—"
3,5,7,Catra,"Adora, stop it. Stop!"
3,5,7,Adora,Mara! Portal. I think I remember. None of this is right. We're not supposed to be here.
3,5,7,Catra,Adora! Everything's okay.
3,5,7,Adora,"Stop saying that! This isn't right! Everyone keeps telling me everything is perfect, but it's not. …Everyone except Scorpia."
3,5,7,Catra,"Adora! Adora, where are you going?"
3,5,8,Adora,You don't think things are perfect!
3,5,8,Scorpia,"Whoa! Ever hear of personal space? I happen to take it very seriously. And also, …what are you talking about?"
3,5,8,Adora,"Things aren't right! You must feel it, too. I'm not sure why yet, but I'm starting to remember. …I need to get into Hordak's sanctum and you need to help me!"
3,5,8,Scorpia,"Hordak's sanctum. I'm not sure if you know, but no one is allowed in there without express permission. I mean, this is basic stuff. Are you sure you're qualified to be a Force Captain?"
3,5,8,Adora,"All of my memories stop in Hordak's sanctum. There's something in there…something powerful and dangerous, and that's where it all started. That's where I have to go to fix things!"
3,5,8,Scorpia,"Okay, Adora, I totally hear you. Everything's gonna be fine. In fact, I think I know some nice people who can help if you just—"
3,5,8,Adora,"Scorpia, you have to remember something. Tell me you remember. Everyone's acting like things are perfect, except for you… Even Catra is—"
3,5,8,Scorpia,Catra…
3,5,8,Adora,You do remember…
3,5,8,Scorpia,"No, I— I mean, I-I don't know. And Catra she—she was just scared, she didn't mean to—What is going on? I keep-I keep forgetting things. This… This is all wrong. How did we get here?"
3,5,8,Adora,I don't know. All I know is that we have to get to Hordak's sanctum.
3,5,9,Scorpia,HOW DID WE GET HERE?
3,5,9,Adora,"Just go with it, okay? We need to get past those guards."
3,5,9,Scorpia,"Oh, man, this is a bad plan! What happens if we get caught? We are so fired!"
3,5,9,Scorpia,"Enough, stop it. Don't, just—just move, move."
3,5,9,Other,Hey! What are you doing here? Hands up!
3,5,9,Scorpia,Did I just do that?! I am so fired.
3,5,9,Adora,Scorpia. You need to focus. None of that matters.
3,5,9,Scorpia,I don't like this.
3,5,9,Scorpia,"Uh, wasn't there a door here just a second ago?"
3,5,9,Adora,"Things are disappearing. It's getting worse. We have to hurry, there's-there's gotta be another way in. …There! It's that lady!"
3,5,9,Scorpia,What lady?
3,5,9,Adora,The one who says “Mara.” Come on!
3,5,9,Scorpia,"Okay, that makes no sense! But I'm gonna follow you because I don't see a lot of other options."
3,5,10,Adora,Wait!
3,5,10,Scorpia,"Oh, she's so fast. …Okay."
3,5,10,Scorpia,Why… is everyone… so… fast? Whoa.
3,5,10,Adora,This is it. Come on.
3,5,10,Scorpia,I hope this works.
3,5,10,Adora,It will. And then you can go back to hating me.
3,5,10,Scorpia,"Look. If you get us out of this, I promise I won't hate you. I will just dislike you a reasonable amount."
3,5,10,Adora,Deal.
3,5,10,Adora,"No. No, no…"
3,5,10,Adora,"This can't be right. It was here, it was right here. Where is it?!"
3,5,10,Adora,"Catra. It was Catra. Catra did this, she captured me, she took-- …the sword. She activated the portal."
3,5,10,Scorpia,Sword?
3,5,10,Adora,"The sword. There's supposed to be a sword. My sword. But it's gone. It's in the portal! That's why we're here, I need to find it!"
3,5,10,Scorpia,"Quick, hide!"
3,5,10,Scorpia,That was close.
3,5,10,Adora,Run!
3,5,10,Scorpia,"What is happening?! I don't understand what is going on! Adora, wait! Wait up!"
3,5,10,Adora,Scorpia? Scorpia!
3,5,11,Adora,Wait!
3,5,11,Razz,"Why, hello, Mara, dearie!"
3,5,11,Adora,Who are you? Why do I know you? What are you doing in the Fright Zone? Is this real?
3,5,11,Razz,"I am afraid so, dearie. But you can still fix it. There's still time!"
3,5,11,Razz,"Find me in the woods, dearie!"
3,5,11,Lonnie,"Adora! Adora, where have you been?!"
3,5,11,Adora,"Lonnie, we have to get out of here. Where are Kyle and Rogelio?"
3,5,11,Lonnie,Who?
3,5,11,Adora,Our…teammates since we were kids. Where are they?
3,5,11,Lonnie,Uh…I don't remember… I think… I think they're gone? What is going on?!
3,5,11,Adora,Come on!
3,5,12,Adora,"Lonnie, we have to…"
3,5,12,Adora,Catra!
3,5,12,Catra,Adora—
3,5,12,Catra,"Hey! You've officially lost it, haven't you?!"
3,5,12,Adora,"Listen, we have to go. Now! Scorpia, Lonnie, Kyle, Rogelio, they're all gone."
3,5,12,Catra,What are you talking about? Who's gone?
3,5,12,Adora,They're gone! There's nothing left. And we'll be next if we don't get out of here right now.
3,5,12,Catra,"You're not making any sense. Everything's fine, okay? It's--"
3,5,12,Adora,"Don't say it's perfect! I know it's not perfect, and so do you!"
3,5,12,Catra,You've gone crazy. I'm not going anywhere.
3,5,12,Adora,Catra…
3,5,12,Catra,What are you--?!
3,5,13,Adora,"Catra, no!"
3,5,13,Adora,"Catra, you can't. We need to get as far from the Fright Zone as possible or we'll be completely erased along with everything else."
3,5,13,Catra,You think you can convince me by kidnapping me?! What is wrong with you?
3,5,13,Adora,I won't leave you behind again.
3,5,13,Catra,Why can't you just stay? We have everything we ever wanted.
3,5,13,Adora,"It's not real, Catra. As much as I wish that things could be simple the way they used to be, there's no going back."
3,5,13,Adora,Why did you do it?
3,5,13,Catra,I don't know what you're talking about!
3,5,13,Adora,There's no time. We have to go.
3,5,13,Adora,You look out for me and I look out for you. Nothing really bad can happen as long as we have each other.
3,5,13,Catra,You promise?
3,5,13,Adora,I-
3,5,13,Adora,I promise. Everything will be okay if we just stay together.
3,5,13,Adora,Come with me. You don't have to go back there. We can fix this.
3,5,13,Adora,Help me fix this. Please!
3,5,13,Adora,This can't be what you wanted!
3,5,13,Catra,Don't you get it?! I am never going to go with you!
3,5,13,Catra,"You always have to go and ruin it, don't you?"
3,5,13,Adora,"Catra, look what's happening! You're going to destroy everything!"
3,5,13,Catra,I don't care. I won't let you win. I'd rather see the whole world end than let that happen.
3,5,13,Adora,"Catra, no!"
3,5,13,Adora,Catra!
3,5,14,Razz,"Oh, is that you, Mara? You made it after all."
3,5,14,Adora,Madame Razz.
3,5,14,Razz,"It's been such a long time since we last saw each other, hasn't it? That or…it hasn't happened yet. I always get those two things mixed up."
3,5,14,Adora,I couldn't save anyone else.
3,5,14,Razz,"It's not too late. You can still bring them back, but you must act quickly."
3,5,14,Adora,How do you know all of this?!
3,5,14,Razz,"Because this has all happened before! I remember it like it was yesterday. For Madame Razz, it was yesterday…"
3,5,14,Adora,This happened before…with Mara!
3,5,14,Razz,"Yes, dearie. When she moved Etheria and took away the stars. Heh, it was crazy."
3,5,14,Adora,It's all my fault. I've been so afraid of becoming another Mara. Destroying the world the way she did…and now…it's happening.
3,5,14,Razz,"Destroy the world? No. Mara saved the world, and so will you. But you can't waste any more time. You need to go back to the beginning. You need to find the sword. That is the only way this will stop!"
3,5,14,Adora,"I did that, didn't I? I went back to the Fright Zone. The portal wasn't there!"
3,5,14,Razz,"No, that wasn't the beginning. You need to go back to the very beginning."
3,5,14,Adora,I-I-I don't understand.
3,5,14,Razz,"That's all right, dearie. You don't need to understand. You just need to remember."
3,5,14,Adora,I have to remember…
3,5,14,Adora,Bow and Glimmer. I need to find them!
3,5,14,Razz,"Go on, dearie! Quickly!"
3,6,0,Glimmer,Woohoo!
3,6,0,Glimmer,"That was awesome, Can we do it one more time?"
3,6,0,Angella,"Oh, that's quite enough for today, Besides-"
3,6,1,Micah,Did you two go flying without me?
3,6,1,Glimmer,Dad. You're back!
3,6,1,Micah,Think fast!
3,6,1,Micah,You're getting good at that.
3,6,1,Glimmer,I've been practicing
3,6,1,Angella,"Yes, She only blew up my flower garden twice."
3,6,1,Angella,Welcome home love.
3,6,1,Micah,"You were having so much fun without me, you cant of missed me much."
3,6,1,Other,Your majesties!
3,6,1,Other,We found a girl sneaking into bright moon through the whispering woods. She was trying to break into the princess's chambers.
3,6,1,Angella,What? Please escort the princess safely to her room until we determine the trespassers intentions.
3,6,1,Adora,Glimmer!
3,6,3,Bow,Glimmer! What is going on? Everyones really freaked out today!
3,6,3,Glimmer,Theres a trespasser in Bright moon! We need to figure out who she is!
3,6,3,Bow,Why do we need to figure out who she is?
3,6,3,Glimmer,"Because... I don't know! I just feel like I know her somehow! So, we're gonna and spy while my parents interrogate her!"
3,6,3,Bow,What?!
3,6,3,Glimmer,"I know it sounds crazy, but she came here for a reason and I need to know why. If you want to stay behind, just tell me."
3,6,3,Bow,I want to stay behind..
3,6,3,Glimmer,"Hmm, Didn't hear anything, Lets go!"
3,6,3,Angella,Bring in the prisoner!
3,6,3,Adora,"King Micah?! You're here? Oh, You look different then your mural."
3,6,3,Micah,"This is a truth spell, You will be compelled to answer honestly. Now tell us, who are you and why did you break into Bright moon?"
3,6,3,Adora,"Uh, Ok, wow, This is gonna be a lot to explain, um- and its going to sound a little weird but I swear its all true. Reality is collapsing in on itself because of the portal that Hordak and Catra set off. They're from the horde, Except you don't remember the horde because the fright zone disappeared Like right now, It was pretty crazy. It got eraised by the portal but I promise it used to exist and we were fighting them with the Princess Alliance."
3,6,3,Adora,And I had a sword that could turn me into an 8 foot tall warrior lady with really great hair called She-ra
3,6,3,Adora,But the horde used the sword to set off the portal and I need Glimmer and Bow to help me stop it and save Etheria!
3,6,3,Micah,i-.. Uh.
3,6,3,Angella,Who are you?! How do you know my daughter and the royal apprentice historian?
3,6,3,Adora,"Hes a historian here? That doesn't matter, we're best friends."
3,6,3,Micah,I've never seen you before..
3,6,3,Adora,"Well thats cause normally, you're dead"
3,6,3,Other,Are you threatening the king?!
3,6,3,Angella,How dare you say such a thing!
3,6,3,Adora,"I'm sorry but none of this is right. You must have noticed it! What did you do yesterday, theres a reason you can't remember. This world isn't real!"
3,6,3,Angella,I have heard quite enough!
3,6,3,Micah,"Angella, Its alright."
3,6,3,Adora,I need to talk to Bow and Glimmer! They're the strongest people I know!
3,6,3,Adora,I need their help to stop reality falling apart!
3,6,3,Micah,"Guards, escort this young woman to our holding cell!"
3,6,3,Micah,The spare room.
3,6,3,Adora,Wait! You have to believe me!
3,6,3,Micah,"Don't listen to her, she's lying."
3,6,3,Angella,But your truth spell...
3,6,3,Micah,I must of done it wrong... Theres no way anything she said could be true. It's- It's not possible!
3,6,4,Adora,Bow! Glimmer! I knew you guys would-
3,6,4,Adora,Do you remember me at all?
3,6,4,Glimmer,"Listen crazy lady! My dad has never messed up a spell, you were telling the truth in there, How can that be?"
3,6,4,Adora,"Of course you were listening in, I should've known."
3,6,4,Bow,Ok will you stop acting like you know us?! We've never met you!
3,6,4,Adora,Yes you have.
3,6,4,Adora,"Bow, You saved our lives more times then I can count. You're a great fighter, a genius inventer, and you shouldn't worry about what your dads think. They're proud of you, just like I am."
3,6,4,Adora,And Glimmer-
3,6,4,Adora,"You never give up or admit defeat, I know making friends is hard for you yet your the one who pulled us all together."
3,6,4,Adora,I've never met anyone like you.
3,6,4,Glimmer,"None of that is true! I'm just a princess, and Bow isn't a fighter, He's.. Bow."
3,6,4,Bow,"This-.. This isn't right.. I mean, everything is perfect. Everyone keeps saying everything's perfect."
3,6,4,Glimmer,My dad... He's gone isn't he?
3,6,4,Adora,yes..
3,6,4,Bow,Woah!
3,6,4,Bow,"Uh, what is that?"
3,6,4,Adora,"Oh no, It's starting to happen here too. We don't have much time."
3,6,4,Glimmer,"So, what do we do now?"
3,6,4,Adora,"We fix reality, uh, somehow.. Razz told me to go back to the beginning. But, I don't know what that means."
3,6,4,Bow,"Ok well, You said a portal started all of this, Can you think of anyone who'd know how to make a-"
3,6,4,Bow,Entrapta...
3,6,4,Adora,Of course! Entrapta
3,6,4,Adora,Glimmer! Can you teleport us to Dryl?
3,6,4,Glimmer,What? I barely managed to teleport me and Bow in here!
3,6,4,Adora,then we'll just have to do this the Best Friends Squad way!
3,6,5,Adora,Run! Go. Go. Go!
3,6,5,Glimmer,This is how we normally do things?!
3,6,5,Adora,"Yeah, We improvise!"
3,6,5,Bow,I really don't like improvising!
3,6,5,Adora,"Ok, we have to get out of Bright moon before it disappears like the Fright zone!"
3,6,5,Other,"Princess, you shouldn't be-"
3,6,5,Other,Is that the prisoner?!
3,6,5,Glimmer,Sorry!
3,6,5,Glimmer,There was a door here!
3,6,5,Bow,"Uh, Guys!?"
3,6,5,Angella,Step away from my daughter! Now!
3,6,5,Glimmer,Mum stop! Can't you see what happening?
3,6,5,Micah,Angie?
3,6,5,Micah,Whats wrong?
3,6,5,Glimmer,"I'm sorry, For everything. But we have to make this right"
3,6,5,Angella,Glimmer!
3,6,5,Entrapta,Hello!
3,6,5,Entrapta,Do I know you?
3,6,6,Micah,Angie?
3,6,6,Micah,"We'll get her back, Angie, and then everything will be perfect again."
3,6,6,Angella,"This is perfect my love, but it's not real."
3,6,6,Angella,I remember now...
3,6,6,Angella,"I miss you so much... But Glimmer needs my help, and I can't stay with nothing but memories."
3,6,6,Micah,Angella I-... I-
3,6,6,Angella,Goodbye Micah.
3,6,6,Micah,"Angie, Angella wait! I'm not-"
3,6,7,Entrapta,This is facinating! I've never had non-robots visit me before! Usually it's just me and all my friends.
3,6,7,Adora,Friends?
3,6,7,Entrapta,Aren't they amazing!?
3,6,7,Entrapta,"And if they break, I can just make new friends!"
3,6,7,Entrapta,Tiny snacks?
3,6,7,Entrapta,"Oh, sorry about that. They're still getting the hang of human food. Unless this is what you eat! I have so many questions, Tell me everything!"
3,6,7,Adora,"Entrapta, I know what i'm about to say sounds crazy-"
3,6,7,Entrapta,Is this about the unstable portal slowly consuming and warping our reality?
3,6,7,Adora,"Now you're not gonna believe- Wait, What did you just say?"
3,6,7,Entrapta,"Oh, I figured it out a while ago. An unstable portal is the only thing that would account for all the anomalies I've been picking up in my research. The portal exists somewhere in our world and as long as it's still open it's gonna keep to destablising reality, making things disappear faster and faster until, Bam! Nothing's left!"
3,6,7,Entrapta,Which is a bad thing...
3,6,7,Adora,How do we stop it?
3,6,7,Entrapta,Portals are gateways..
3,6,7,Entrapta,"Wormholes that connect one area of space to another, The only way to turn it off is from the inside. But, who ever shuts down the portal can't leave. they'll be trapped between realities, possibly forever."
3,6,7,Entrapta,Oh! Imagine the data they could collect!
3,6,7,Glimmer,"Wait, so whoever turns it off will be trapped inside it forever?"
3,6,7,Entrapta,Exactly.
3,6,7,Adora,"There must be another way! Try to remember Entrapta, when you and Hordak built the portal machine-"
3,6,7,Entrapta,"Remember...I.. remember, I had a lab partner, Hordak, we were friends and then Catra... Oh, I remember everything now...I'm not really here."
3,6,7,Adora,"No, No this can't be happening already. We should of had more time!"
3,6,7,Entrapta,"There is no more time, It all makes sense now, it's your sword, the portal is centred on you! It's following you!"
3,6,7,Adora,What?
3,6,7,Adora,No!
3,6,7,Entrapta,"You need to remove the sword from the inside, It's powering the portal"
3,6,7,Entrapta,As soon as it's gone everything will be alright again! {sadly] It was nice being friends with you..
3,6,7,Adora,"Entrapta, No!"
3,6,8,Glimmer,Where are we?
3,6,8,Adora,We're at the beacon. Stars?
3,6,8,Glimmer,"Adora, what is happening?"
3,6,8,Adora,It's what Entrapta said. Reality is unraveling faster now. I – I think we might be too late. Mara? Stay here. Entrapta said the portal is centered on me. You're at risk as long as we're together. If I draw it away –
3,6,8,Glimmer,"No. I know what you're thinking, Adora. You said you knew us? Well, we know you."
3,6,8,Bow,You can't relax to save your life. You're terrible at acting.
3,6,8,Glimmer,"You're stubborn and headstrong, and you're our best friend."
3,6,8,Adora,"Wait, no."
3,6,8,Glimmer,"You got this, Adora. We believe in you."
3,6,8,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
3,6,9,Catra,Oh... Where are your friends?
3,6,9,Adora,"Catra, stop. You have to--"
3,6,9,Catra,"It's always the same with you, Adora. “I have to do this. Oh, we have to do that.” Let's be honest, all of this is your fault."
3,6,10,Catra,"If you hadn't gotten captured, your sword wouldn't have opened the portal. If you hadn't gotten the sword and been the world's worst She-Ra, none of this would've happened."
3,6,11,Catra,"Admit it, Adora, the world would still be standing if you had never come through that portal in the first place."
3,6,12,Catra,You made me this. You took everything from me.
3,6,13,Catra,"You broke the world, and it is all your fault."
3,6,13,Adora,"No, it's not."
3,6,14,Adora,"I didn't make you pull the switch. I didn't make you do anything. I didn't break the world, but I am gonna fix it. And you? You  made your choice. Now live with it."
3,6,14,Angella,Adora!
3,6,14,Angella,Hold on!
3,6,14,Angella,"I remember, Adora. I know this world isn't our own. How do we fix this?"
3,6,14,Adora,Go back to the beginning. Razz meant my beginning. The the place I came through as a baby. I can fix everything. I just need to go into the portal and pull out the sword. That'll turn it off and everyone will come back safe and sound.
3,6,14,Angella,"And you'll come back safe, too? Adora, you'll come back, too, right?"
3,6,14,Adora,I have to do this. This is my destiny.
3,6,14,Angella,"Oh, Adora, no. This is not it."
3,6,14,Adora,But... this is the only way to fix things.
3,6,14,Angella,Do you want to know a secret? I am a coward.
3,6,14,Adora,What? No.
3,6,14,Angella,"I've always been the queen who stays behind. Micah was the brave one. And then Glimmer... Oh, Glimmer. So much like her father. And once again I stayed behind, letting her make the hard choices, letting her be brave for me. I told myself I was being responsible, but, Adora, I was just scared. And then I met you. You inspired us. You inspired me. Not because it was your destiny, but because you never let fear stop you. And now I choose to be brave."
3,6,14,Adora,No! Your Majesty! Angella!
3,6,14,Angella,Take care of each other.
3,6,14,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
3,6,15,Catra,Huh?
3,6,15,Catra,We have to go now.
3,6,15,Glimmer,Adora.
3,6,15,Bow,Adora.
3,6,15,Glimmer,"See? We told you, you could do it."
3,6,15,Frosta,"Woo-hoo! Yes, we did it. We did it."
3,6,15,Shadow Weaver,"Touching as this is, we need to go. Now!"
3,6,15,Other,laugh and shout
3,6,15,Bow,We did it. Did we do it? We did it.
3,6,15,Glimmer,"I'm probably going to be grounded for the rest of my life, but reality is back to normal. Speaking of which, I guess I should go find my mom. Maybe she'll be so happy to see me that she'll forget about grounding me. Adora? What is it?"
3,6,15,Adora,"Angella, she stayed behind. She – She –"
3,6,15,Adora,She saved us.
3,6,16,Horde Prime,"So, that's where you've been, little brother."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Glimmer, come at once. We need you in the War Room right away! There's no time to waste. You must make a decision."
4,1,0,Adora,We're here for you.
4,1,0,Glimmer,That one!
4,1,0,Castaspella,"The Future Queen has spoken. At Glimmer's coronation, we will be serving – ice cream cake!"
4,1,0,Glimmer,People are starting to arrive. I can't believe this is really my coronation day. Me. Queen Glimmer. Ugh. It sounds so weird.
4,1,0,Bow,"Queen Glimmer. Queen Glimmer. Queen Glimmer! Yeah, that's going to take some getting used to."
4,1,0,Glimmer,I just... never thought it would actually happen.
4,1,0,Adora,Hey don't worry. You've got me and Bow beside you all the way. We'll make sure this day is perfect.
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Yeah, you're right. We've got this. Do I look okay?"
4,1,0,Adora,Like a queen.
4,1,0,Castaspella,Here you all are! What are you standing around for? The guests are starting to arrive! Come on! There's so much to do!
4,1,0,Adora,I'm worried about Glimmer.
4,1,0,Bow,"Must be hard celebrating with
Angella being gone."
4,1,0,Adora,"It's her coronation. This should
be a perfect day for Glimmer. We'll make it perfect. All we have to
do is keep her mind off –"
4,1,0,Bow,Angella?
4,1,0,Adora,"Off everything, yes. Now come
on!"
4,1,0,Castaspella,"So, the ceremony begins
with the Ritual Quest, followed by your first speech as queen and
most importantly, the whole thing ends with a Grand Ball!"
4,1,0,Adora,"Oh, there's a quest!
We're great at quests."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Yes, the Quest of Queens,
in which Glimmer will forge her connection to the Moonstone. The
Moonstone's power has been balanced between you and your mother since
you were born, but now, with her... her absent..."
4,1,0,Bow,"So, about that quest! We're great
at quests, right guys?"
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Yes, it's all in the
scrolls. Secret ritual, witnesses, light, etcetera, etcetera."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Oh, and you'll need this. Are those the flower arrangements? Glimmer, what do you
think?"
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Oh, uh, they're, uh, fine?"
4,1,0,Castaspella,"You're right, they're
awful! Burn them at once. Also, you're fired."
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Aunt Casta, you don't ..."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Don't you worry about a
thing. In addition to being a powerful sorceress, I am also a
legendary party-planner. This will be a coronation for the ages! 
Glimmer, take us to the terrace!"
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Oh, we're-- We're walking,
are we? Great. We can use the exercise."
4,1,0,Frosta,"What do you think? I wanted to
do something special for you."
4,1,0,Glimmer,This is going to be awful.
4,1,0,Frosta,"Awful inspiring, right? I can
make more!"
4,1,0,Glimmer,"I appreciate the idea. But I
need someone for a very important job to, uh, greet the guests."
4,1,0,Frosta,"Oh, you need a bouncer! I'm on
it! Bouncer!"
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Wait, I didn't say bouncer.
Okay."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Glimmer! I need your
opinion on color schemes."
4,1,0,Glimmer,Uh...blue? What about purple?
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Excellent choice. Isn't
this fun? Soon you will have to make many decisions, just like your
mother... That is, uh-- Chop, chop, everyone! Adora, move the ice
sculpture to the side! We still need flower arrangements! Where is
that florist?"
4,1,0,Glimmer,You fired him.
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Oh, right. Perhaps you'd
like to do the flowers, Glimmer?"
4,1,0,Glimmer,Uhhh
4,1,0,Bow,Hmm.
4,1,0,Glimmer,"you know, I bet Mermista would
love to do the flowers! Right Mermista?"
4,1,0,Mermista,"Wow, how did you know? Flower
arranging is my passion."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Ah! Wonderful! Now let's
talk stem length."
4,1,0,Perfuma,What? No! Why?
4,1,0,Swift Wind,"Is now a good time to talk
about my song for the coronation? I will require a stage, and oats
for the backup horses."
4,1,0,Frosta,"Stop bothering Glimmer!
Bouncer!"
4,1,0,Adora,"Hey! I think it's all really
coming together, don't you?"
4,1,0,Adora,"yep, it's gonna be perfect! What
else we need to do, Bow?"
4,1,0,Bow,"Still don't know what the lantern
is for! This is all so official and confusing. And it says Glimmer
needs to wear some ceremonial robe. But I don't know where to get
that!"
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Maybe if we all looked
together--"
4,1,0,Adora,Don't worry! We will find it!
4,1,0,Glimmer,But –
4,1,0,Adora,"The two of us will find it for
you."
4,1,0,Castaspella,"Glimmer, you're needed in
the Dining Room at once to choose the napkin folding technique! I'm
thinking swans, what do you think?"
4,1,0,Glimmer,Uh...I...
4,1,0,Castaspella,"You're right, it's a
terrible idea. I should just fire myself."
4,1,0,Glimmer,"Aunt Casta, no –"
4,1,0,Castaspella,Mermista! Vases!
4,1,0,Mermista,Don't stifle my creativity!
4,1,0,Castaspella,Uhg. Please.
4,1,0,Adora,"It's okay, we will handle
everything. You go have fun!"
4,1,0,Glimmer,Fun. Right.
4,1,1,Catra,"Hordak. Our troops are just
sitting around. What are we waiting for? We need to talk about plans
for--"
4,1,1,Hordak,"Plans? Your last plan
was to set off the portal machine before it was ready. Do you
remember how that ended?"
4,1,1,Catra,"Whatever. It worked out for us,
didn't it? The Rebellion's a mess. Their queen is gone. Now's our
chance to gain the upper hand."
4,1,1,Hordak,"And how are we going to do that
when you couldn't even prevent the Rebellion from infiltrating the
Fright Zone?"
4,1,1,Catra,"Yeah, like I said before, it was
Entrapta who--"
4,1,1,Catra,Great so--
4,1,1,Hordak,"That's the only reason you're
here instead of facing punishment for your failure. Now get out!"
4,1,2,Bow,"Well, it took some searching, but
we finally found the Royal Coronation Robe!"
4,1,2,Adora,"Wow, Glimmer! You look... Um"
4,1,2,Castaspella,"Oh, my little Glimmer. I'm
so proud of you. I know you're going to make such a wonderful queen.
Well, almost time for your quest! Give me a tick and this robe will
fit like a dream!"
4,1,2,Glimmer,"Of course. The quest we still
don't know anything about. But it'll be fine. Castaspella will fix
the robe, Bow has the lantern, and I'll have you guys by my side the
whole way. Right?"
4,1,2,Bow,"Umm... Right! Hey, um, Adora, can
I talk to you real quick? I don't know where the lantern is! Glimmer
can't do the quest without it, and she can't be queen without the
quest! I've doomed the entire kingdom!"
4,1,2,Adora,"Bow, calm down! We just have to
find the lantern, and Glimmer will be none the wiser. It has to be
around here somewhere, right? This day is going to be perfect!"
4,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"There's no need to be
alarmed. I'm a guest now. Can't you tell? Please, convey my best
wishes to our new queen. I hope you two are till close. Power changes
people."
4,1,2,Adora,"Glimmer is a good friend. She'll
be a good queen, too."
4,1,2,Shadow Weaver,"Hmm. I hope for your
sake, you're right."
4,1,2,Frosta,"Adora, I've been freezing
anyone trying to sneak in, but I'm running out of space to put them."
4,1,2,Adora,Unfreeze him right now!
4,1,2,Perfuma,"Hmmm! Mermista, um, flowers
are sort of my thing."
4,1,2,Mermista,"Uh, it's art and it's what
Glimmer wants. New queen, new era."
4,1,2,Frosta,"Stop fighting! You're
ruining Glimmer's big day! Bouncer!"
4,1,2,Bow,"Okay, has anyone seen a sacred
lantern?"
4,1,2,Mermista,Yeah. There.
4,1,2,Adora,"Oh! We've been looking all over
for it! Thanks, Swifty."
4,1,2,Swift Wind,"And I'll present it to
Queen Glimmer. And she'll be all, 'Swift Wind, why don't you sing the
coronation song you made up?”"
4,1,2,Mermista,"Glimmer, can you please tell
Perfuma to stop questioning your wise judgment?"
4,1,2,Glimmer,What? I'm not--
4,1,2,Frosta,"Where do you keep the blankets?
Sea Hawk is whining about being frozen."
4,1,2,Glimmer,Why did you free...?
4,1,2,Castaspella,"Glimmer, the quest is due
to begin. Where's the lantern?"
4,1,2,Swift Wind,"I have it! And now, my
song!"
4,1,2,Perfuma,"Everyone knows Glimmer would
be happier with me on flowers!"
4,1,2,Mermista,Glimmer obviously disagrees.
4,1,2,Castaspella,"Glimmer, your guests are
waiting."
4,1,2,Frosta,"Everyone, stop bothering
Glimmer. She has a ton on her plate..."
4,1,2,Glimmer,"Everyone, just stop!"
4,1,2,Castaspella,"Glimmer, we will fix all
of this."
4,1,2,Glimmer,Let's just get this over with.
4,1,3,Catra,What are you doing in here?
4,1,3,Scorpia,"Oh, uh--"
4,1,3,Catra,"You heard Hordak. He wants all
this junk disposed of as soon as possible."
4,1,3,Scorpia,"Hey, so, I know you made a
heat of the moment decision which I totally get, but, um, you didn't
really want Entrapta to stay on Beast Island forever. Anyway, I was
thinking we cold go back and get her? I mean, she is our friend."
4,1,3,Catra,"Entrapta betrayed us, and got
what she deserved."
4,1,3,Scorpia,"But she didn't betray us. She
wanted to save us from the portal. And she was right, if Adora hadn't
shut it down--"
4,1,3,Catra,"Entrapta betrayed Hordak. As for
the portal, it left the Rebellion in shambles, and that means it
worked. Got it? Good. Now, get this place cleared out."
4,1,3,Scorpia,It's okay. You can come out.
4,1,3,Scorpia,"Hey there, Emily. Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you."
4,1,4,Castaspella,"We are gathered here today
to witness the crowning of Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon as she
completes the Quest of Queens and begins her reign as our new leader.
She will be accompanied by two witnesses, Master Archer Bow, and
Adora, She-Ra, Princess of Power. Let the light guide you and go
forth in peace and safety to emerge as Queen of Bright Moon."
4,1,4,Adora,"So, quest! Heh. We're good at
quests."
4,1,4,Glimmer,"Can we just do this, please? I
don't want to think about flowers, or colors, or stupid decisions.
And we're bad at quests."
4,1,4,Bow,"Wow. I can't believe these
tunnels have been underneath our feet all this time."
4,1,4,Adora,"So, how deep down do you think
we are?"
4,1,4,Glimmer,"Okay, what's with you guys?
Stop acting like this!"
4,1,4,Adora,Like what?
4,1,4,Glimmer,Like-- Like-- Like this!
4,1,4,Adora,"Glimmer, we're just--"
4,1,4,Glimmer,"Whatever. None of this even
matters!"
4,1,4,Bow,"Wait, look!"
4,1,4,Bow,"I think-- I think this is the
Chamber of Queens!"
4,1,4,Adora,Look!
4,1,4,Bow,"That altar. I read about that in
the scroll. I think it's for the lantern."
4,1,4,Adora,Is this part of the quest?
4,1,4,Bow,Teeth! Giant Teeth!
4,1,4,Glimmer,The lantern!
4,1,4,Bow,Glimmer!
4,1,4,Adora,Glimmer!
4,1,4,Adora,The scroll didn't mention a giant angry monster living in the tunnels under Bright Moon?
4,1,4,Bow,"Come to think of it, I might remember some mention of a Bright Moon guardian that we'd have to subdue."
4,1,4,Adora,Bow!
4,1,4,Bow,It was confusingly worded!
4,1,4,Adora,"We need to get out of here. Come on, teleport us out!"
4,1,4,Glimmer,I-- I can't teleport!
4,1,4,Adora,Glimmer!
4,1,4,Bow,What? Why not?
4,1,4,Glimmer,I haven't been recharging my powers!
4,1,4,Adora,What!
4,1,4,Bow,What!
4,1,4,Glimmer,"Recharging would mean taking the Moonstone's full power for myself. It would mean... admitting that she's really gone. Everyone is already acting like she doesn't matter. It's like no one remembers her. No one cares. We're having a coronation because she's gone, and everyone is acting like it's a fun party and it's not."
4,1,4,Adora,"Of course it's not. I just thought talking about it... About her. It hurts. I'm supposed to take care of you, Glimmer. It's the last thing she asked me to do. I wanted to make today perfect. But I..."
4,1,4,Bow,We just don't know what to do.
4,1,4,Glimmer,I don't know either. But maybe we can still figure it out. Together.
4,1,4,Adora,"Whatever path you choose, we'll always be there, right beside you."
4,1,4,Glimmer,Even if that path leads to a giant crystal monster?
4,1,4,Adora,Especially if the path leads to a giant crystal monster.
4,1,4,Bow,Nothing we can't handle. We're great at quests.
4,1,4,Glimmer,Then come on. Let's do this.
4,1,4,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
4,1,4,Glimmer,Hey! Over here!
4,1,4,Bow,Glimmer!
4,1,4,Adora,Run!
4,1,4,Glimmer,"No. I'm Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon, and you will leave my friends alone."
4,1,4,Angella,Glimmer?
4,1,4,Glimmer,Mom?
4,1,4,Angella,"Glimmer, You are walking in the footsteps of all those who have come before us. Now, my darling, it's your turn. I wish I didn't have to leave you. But I know you will be all right. Because you are Glimmer, and you are so, so strong. I have done my best to prepare you to rule, but you were always ready to lead. I am so proud of you, Glimmer. I love you."
4,1,4,Glimmer,I love you too mom.
4,1,4,Bow,"You okay, Your Majesty?"
4,1,4,Glimmer,"As long as you two are with me, I am. Now come on, let's get out of here."
4,1,4,Glimmer,This place looks amazing!
4,1,4,Frosta,We wanted it to be perfect for you.
4,1,4,Perfuma,So we worked together to finish.
4,1,4,Mermista,That was my idea.
4,1,4,Castaspella,"Glimmer, it's time."
4,1,4,Glimmer,"I'm here today because Queen Angella, my mother, sacrificed herself to save Etheria. We can't let her bravery be in vain. But there's so much we still need to do. Hordak is still in power, and we know there's an even larger Horde army out there somewhere. We can't let them win. It's time for us to take back our home. Together we will push out the Horde, once and for all!"
4,1,4,Bow,Yeah! Wooo!
4,1,5,Catra,purring
4,1,5,Catra,"Hey, Hordak."
4,1,5,Hordak,What do you think you're doing?
4,1,5,Hordak,How dare you.
4,1,5,Catra,Missing something? Looks like you're ready to listen.
4,1,5,Hordak,When I finish with you...
4,1,5,Catra,"Hey, cheer up, boss. You said it yourself. Big, bad Horde Prime got your signal. Don't you want to conquer Etheria before he gets here? He doesn't sound like the type to accept failure."
4,1,5,Hordak,What do you want?
4,1,5,Catra,"We're done with your little vanity projects. It's time to crush the Rebellion, for good. And you're going to help me do that. I think you and I are going to do great things together."
4,1,5,Other,Episode Transcript List
4,2,0,Adora,"So, where's Glimmer again? Didn't she call us here?"
4,2,0,Bow,"Uh, I'm sure she'll be here soon."
4,2,0,Glimmer,You're all here! Good. Just one second.
4,2,0,Adora,Glimmer...
4,2,0,Huntara,"Oh, I see. She's really taking this queen stuff seriously."
4,2,0,Glimmer,"As part of my new anti-Horde strategy, I'm sending you, Adora, Bow and Huntara on a mission to retrieve Mara's ship from the Crimson Waste. Then, Bow will repair it and then we'll have a spaceship! Take that, Horde."
4,2,0,Adora,"Uh, Glimmer?"
4,2,0,Glimmer,What?
4,2,0,Adora,"The Crimson Waste is a desert. Doesn't Mermista need, like, water to use her powers?"
4,2,0,Glimmer,"Oh, good point. Be right back!"
4,2,0,Huntara,She gonna do that all the time now?
4,2,0,Adora,"Oh, definitely."
4,2,0,Other,Did I hear the queen? She's needed in the defence meeting immediately.
4,2,0,Perfuma,"Oh! Hello, everyone. What a wonderful... …interruption to my morning meditation, and to see so much of our beautiful planet before I've had my daily tea ceremony."
4,2,0,Glimmer,"Sorry, I may have gotten a little lost on the way. But, like I was saying, the Waste has tons of plants which you can use to bring the ship back!"
4,2,0,Perfuma,The C... the Crimson Waste?
4,2,0,Glimmer,"That's the one! As my first act as queen, I'm sending you all on the mission while I… …stay back and do important queen duties."
4,2,0,Adora,Hey! Leave it all to us! It'll probably be a boring mission anyway.
4,2,0,Other,"Queen Glimmer, you are extremely late for your next meeting."
4,2,0,Glimmer,Oh! We'll go the fun way.
4,2,1,Perfuma,"So... this is, like, your kingdom?"
4,2,1,Huntara,I'm not a princess.
4,2,1,Perfuma,"Still, it must be nice to be home. Do you miss it?"
4,2,1,Huntara,I left. Now I'm back. No need to make a big thing out of it.
4,2,1,Perfuma,Mm-hm!
4,2,1,Huntara,"You, um, make flowers?"
4,2,1,Perfuma,I control all plants. Watch.
4,2,1,Huntara,Uh-huh.
4,2,1,Perfuma,It's just something I'm blessed to be able to-
4,2,1,Huntara,"Uh-huh. Blessed. If we run into trouble, is Flower Girl gonna be able to handle herself?"
4,2,1,Adora,"Oh, Perfuma? Oh yeah, she's a demon in battle."
4,2,1,Adora,"Plus, I got this!"
4,2,1,Huntara,A bracelet?
4,2,1,Adora,"No. This is how I'll carry my sword from now on! It's pretty great, right?"
4,2,1,Huntara,"I know you trained with the Horde, too, but I think all this time with the princesses has made you soft."
4,2,1,Adora,Soft? Are you serious? I'm as tough as ever. I bet I can beat you to the ship.
4,2,1,Huntara,Never gonna happen.
4,2,1,Bow,"Here, lemme help."
4,2,1,Perfuma,What are you...?
4,2,1,Bow,I'm trying to expand my arsenal with new tech. What do you think?
4,2,1,Perfuma,Why would you have an arrow for this? It just seems like there are easier ways! Your intention was kind. Thank you.
4,2,1,Bow,Wanna talk about it?
4,2,1,Perfuma,"I'm really trying to be zen about this, but if I'm being honest, and I always try to speak my truth, I just don't get cacti! They're just so rough and unfriendly!"
4,2,1,Bow,"Well... maybe if you give cacti a chance, you'll find that under that rough surface, she's a really great friend!"
4,2,1,Perfuma,Huh?
4,2,1,Bow,"Uh... this cacti thing is about Huntara, right?"
4,2,1,Perfuma,"What? No, I really mean cacti. They're the one plant I can't control or keep alive and everyone says they're so easy, but you still have to water them, and I always under-water then over-water and I..."
4,2,1,Perfuma,"That's better. I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I greet each dawn with a centering morning ritual to make sure I am my best self but today my ritual was interrupted. And now I am here. Surrounded by cacti. Cacti that hate me. How am I ever gonna use them to move the ship?"
4,2,1,Bow,Uh... that may not matter.
4,2,1,Adora,I can't- I can't believe the Horde took the ship. Also I could've run more.
4,2,1,Huntara,Or it could've been any number of Crimson Waste scavengers. And I could've run more.
4,2,1,Perfuma,"Gosh, well, I guess we'll just have to come back another time."
4,2,1,Adora,"Yep, I'm ready."
4,2,1,Bow,Sorry… it's my pad. I souped it up so Glimmer can check in.
4,2,1,Glimmer,How's the mission? Got the ship yet?
4,2,1,Adora,No.
4,2,1,Bow,Well…
4,2,1,Adora,Hang up. Bow-
4,2,1,Bow,There's a small problem…
4,2,1,Adora,"Turn it off. No, Bow. Stop it."
4,2,1,Glimmer,What's Adora doing?
4,2,1,Bow,"Dancing! Because, uh… But we, um, have to go do more mission stuff now! Talk later!"
4,2,1,Glimmer,"Wait, don't-"
4,2,1,Adora,There's no reason to worry her. We'll find the ship!
4,2,1,Huntara,This is my home turf. Huntara can track anything in the Waste.
4,2,1,Adora,I'm an expert tracker too!
4,2,1,Huntara,"Then you know… it's all in the sand. Mm-hm. Rubber, mechanical. You may be right, it was the Horde."
4,2,1,Adora,"Uh-huh. Definitely… definitely getting rubber, and, uh… uh, sand."
4,2,1,Bow,"We could also, you know, just… follow these."
4,2,2,Huntara,"Oh, of course. I should have known!"
4,2,2,Bow,Uh… should you though? Because I don't see anything.
4,2,2,Perfuma,"Oh well, we tried!"
4,2,2,Huntara,"Don't give up yet, Flower Girl. The Valley of the Lost. It's a smuggler's haven and my home."
4,2,2,Adora,How are we supposed to find anything in there?
4,2,2,Huntara,This has been my gang's base since I arrived here. Nothing can hide from me in this valley.
4,2,2,Other,Come back here!
4,2,2,Adora,No! Shh. Catra's goons are here.
4,2,2,Huntara,"They're not her goons, they're my goons. I just never got a chance to fire them. I'll fix that now."
4,2,2,Perfuma,Maybe it's best to avoid confrontation?
4,2,2,Huntara,"You afraid to fight, Flower Girl?"
4,2,2,Adora,"No, Perfuma's right. If they're here there are sure to be others, we'll be outnumbered."
4,2,2,Huntara,I don't like not fighting.
4,2,2,Adora,Understood. But finding the ship is our mission.
4,2,2,Other,"They went this way, over here!"
4,2,2,Bow,The Valley is crawling with Horde soldiers. And we still don't know where the ship is!
4,2,2,Huntara,This is still my home. And I know who can help.
4,2,3,Catra,Careful! We need this junk intact so Hordak can make new weapons.
4,2,3,Scorpia,"Oh, I am so sorry about that. That- this isn't what I want to be happening right now! Okay, sorry, sorry."
4,2,3,Catra,That was fast.
4,2,3,Scorpia,"What, did you miss me already?"
4,2,3,Catra,Just… don't drop anything else.
4,2,3,Scorpia,"Nah, these guys look like they've got it covered. I'd rather hang out in here with you."
4,2,3,Catra,What is going on?
4,2,3,Scorpia,"Again, I am just so sorry about- Okay! This is… this is a thing that I'm seeing. Are you also seeing two of me? Oh, I have a twin! I always felt this emptiness inside and like there was someone who would just understand. Oh, this is making so much sense to me! Ugh, who am I kidding, Hordak probably cloned me. I signed a lot of paperwork at some point."
4,2,3,Scorpia,"Yeah, being quiet now."
4,2,3,Catra,Who are you and what exactly are you trying to pull?
4,2,4,Perfuma,Are you sure we can trust her contact?
4,2,4,Huntara,You scared?
4,2,4,Adora,Of course not.
4,2,4,Huntara,"Good, ‘cause we're here."
4,2,4,Huntara,"Ugh, who would pay for this junk?"
4,2,4,Other,Fools.
4,2,4,Other,You shouldn't be here. It's not safe. Hurry!
4,2,4,Huntara,"Grox, what's going on? Where's the rest of the gang?"
4,2,4,Other,"Hiding. The Waste has been infested with Horde scum since you left. Can't turn without running into them, interfering with business."
4,2,4,Other,Things here haven't been easy. You're a real sight for small eyes.
4,2,4,Huntara,"You too. Grox, I need your help. We're looking for a ship"
4,2,4,Other,And I've got just the thing to help.
4,2,4,Other,"Aha. Found it. Now, before I do this, Huntara, I need you to remember one thing. One very important thing you forgot."
4,2,4,Other,This is the Crimson Waste. Trust no one.
4,2,4,Other,I've got the rebel intruders!
4,2,4,Huntara,You sold us out? Look at you. The Huntara I knew would've seen this coming. You've gone…soft.
4,2,4,Other,They're in there! Come on!
4,2,4,Adora,Leave her. We have to go.
4,2,4,Huntara,I'll be back for you.
4,2,4,Other,Run along now. That's what you're good at.
4,2,4,Other,They went out the back!
4,2,4,Huntara,"Looks like there's no avoiding a fight now, Princess."
4,2,4,Adora,For the honour of Grayskull!
4,2,4,Adora,"Perfuma, cactus. Block off this alley so they can't surround us."
4,2,4,Perfuma,You can do this. You can do this!
4,2,4,Perfuma,"Ow, ow! Ugh, I can't do this!"
4,2,4,Huntara,Run!
4,2,4,Adora,Bow! Turn it off!
4,2,4,Glimmer,Ugh! I'm in the middle of the most boring meeting.
4,2,4,Bow,Can't talk! We're being chased through a smuggler's den right now!
4,2,4,Glimmer,You are? That sounds so fun!
4,2,4,Huntara,Quiet that thing!
4,2,4,Bow,I'm gonna have to call you back.
4,2,4,Glimmer,"Wait, don't hang u-"
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"Pleasure to meet you. The name's Double Trouble, and I'm about to become your new best friend."
4,2,5,Catra,Oh yeah? I'm done with best friends.
4,2,5,Catra,Enough games! What do you want from me?
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"It's not what I want from you, it's what you want from me."
4,2,5,Catra,All I want from you is to stop being me!
4,2,5,Double Trouble,Oh! Sorry. I plain forgot. Sometimes I just get so lost in my character.
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"Ta-da! Ah, thank you, thank you."
4,2,5,Scorpia,I gotta sit down.
4,2,5,Catra,This is what you really look like?
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"More or less. Of course, we all wear costumes. I just happen to be able to wear other people as costumes. For a price."
4,2,5,Catra,Huh. So it's money you're after.
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"Aren't we all, darling? But if you don't require someone with my… gifts, I'll just take my business to the other side!"
4,2,5,Catra,How exactly are you planning on doing that?
4,2,5,Double Trouble,I have a knack for getting out of tight spots.
4,2,5,Scorpia,What?
4,2,5,Catra,And you can change into anyone? Anytime?
4,2,5,Double Trouble,"Ugh. Change? What I do is so much more than changing. I prefer “transform”! My real gift is committing to my roles. Sure, I can physically replicate anyone, but that doesn't mean a thing if you can't be them emotionally. It's an art."
4,2,5,Other,"Rebels, in the valley!"
4,2,6,Adora,"Perfuma, what happened out there?"
4,2,6,Perfuma,"Ow! Ah! I hate cacti! There, I said it! I love and honour all things, except cacti! And I don't like spitting or Crimson Waste! It is full of negative energy!"
4,2,6,Huntara,"Well, it wasn't always like this! It used to be a great place, where an honest criminal could carve out a life."
4,2,6,Perfuma,"Well, it's terrible now!"
4,2,6,Huntara,I know!
4,2,6,Perfuma,Ouch!
4,2,6,Glimmer,Did you seriously just hang up on me?
4,2,6,Bow,"Yeah, but just because we were running from the Horde. And now we're hiding from the Horde. Also, the Horde has Mara's ship."
4,2,6,Bow,Sorry!
4,2,6,Adora,We totally have it under contr-
4,2,6,Glimmer,Really? This is so cool. A dire situation. Odds against us. I can't believe I'm missing this for a dumb meeting. Okay. Hang tight. I'm on my way!
4,2,6,Adora,"Wait, wait, wait, Glimmer, don't-"
4,2,6,Adora,"We can't wait for Glimmer. The Horde's probably going to take the ship, or whatever they can get from it, back to the Fright Zone."
4,2,6,Bow,I think I know how to find it. We'll use this!
4,2,6,Bow,Horde badges have tracking devices built in. That's how they found Catra when we… …kidnapped her. I can hack into their system and see where all of the Horde soldiers are in the valley! They're sure to be with the ship.
4,2,6,Bow,And there's our ship.
4,2,7,Adora,"I have a plan. But it's gonna depend on you, Perfuma."
4,2,7,Perfuma,"We should probably come up with a different plan, then."
4,2,7,Adora,"Come on, Perfuma, you're one of the strongest people I know. If you hadn't come to my rescue in the Battle of Bright Moon, I wouldn't even be here right now."
4,2,7,Bow,Or me. You rescued me from the Fright Zone.
4,2,7,Perfuma,"We're not in the Fright Zone. We're here, and I'm just a useless flower girl."
4,2,7,Huntara,"No, you're not. I've been wrong about a lot. I was wrong to leave my home, I was wrong about Grox, and I hope I'm wrong about you, because we need your help."
4,2,7,Perfuma,You want my help?
4,2,7,Adora,For the honour of Grayskull!
4,2,7,Adora,Hello.
4,2,7,Double Trouble,Hey! Careful with the goods.
4,2,8,Huntara,"Ugh, focus! Um, uh… Right? Do it with me. You got it! Alright. Yeah, yeah."
4,2,8,Perfuma,I'm not strong enough to lift this by myself. I don't have to be! We're underground!
4,2,8,Huntara,You're just noticing that now?
4,2,8,Perfuma,You know what else is underground? Roots!
4,2,8,Perfuma,These cacti have the most powerful root system I've ever seen! I was so wrong about them.
4,2,8,Huntara,"Oh, and I was definitely wrong about you, Flower Girl!"
4,2,8,Huntara,We have a problem!
4,2,8,Adora,"I've got something more important to do. It was fun distracting you, though."
4,2,8,Perfuma,Oh!
4,2,8,Adora,How did she get out of that?
4,2,8,Bow,Yeah!
4,2,8,Perfuma,"Yes, we did it!"
4,2,8,Huntara,I'm sorry I doubted you.
4,2,8,Perfuma,It's alright. We were all on a journey of personal growth today. I was so wrong to insult your home… it turns out cacti have flowers too.
4,2,9,Glimmer,"Hey, you didn't save any bad guys for me! I made it here as soon as I could, I only got a little lost… in the ocean. Aw. You should've waited for me."
4,2,9,Adora,Sorry… but we did get the ship! Your first mission as queen is a success!
4,2,9,Glimmer,Hm.
4,2,9,Huntara,"Queen Glimmer, I need to stay, and take the waste back for the rebellion and for my people. I won't abandon my home again."
4,2,9,Perfuma,"Aw, say no, Glimmer! I've gotten fond of this desert rose."
4,2,9,Huntara,Let anyone hear you calling me that and I'll throw you into another exploding cactus.
4,2,9,Glimmer,"Ugh, I don't get it!"
4,2,9,Adora,"Eh, you had to be there."
4,2,10,Scorpia,Wow! Bravo!
4,2,10,Double Trouble,"Oh, stop. Did you really like my audition?"
4,2,10,Catra,“Like” doesn't cover it.
4,2,10,Double Trouble,"Well, I could've used more time to prepare. Really… get into your skin."
4,2,10,Catra,"I grew up with Adora, and you fooled her. If you can do that, we can do anything. This is gonna be fun."
4,3,0,Catra,"This time I am going to win! I don't care what it takes, We are opening that portal. Now!"
4,3,0,Entrapta,"No! I won't, I need to tell Hordak; he'll understand!"
4,3,0,Catra,Get her out of here!
4,3,0,Entrapta,What did you do to me?
4,3,0,Adora,Why did you do it?
4,3,0,Catra,Stay away from me!
4,3,0,Hordak,"Was this your doing, Entrapta?"
4,3,0,Other,Entrapta? Entrapta? Entrapta?
4,3,0,Double Trouble,Hmm. Ouch. What happened here?
4,3,0,Hordak,The rebels managed to capture one of our bots and retrofit it with some sort of surge device. It decimated an entire squadron of our machines.
4,3,0,Catra,"Not to speak ill of the dearly departed, but exactly how many battles have your bots lost us lately?"
4,3,0,Hordak,You'd be wise to watch your tone.
4,3,0,Catra,"Aren't you tired of losing? After all, clock's ticking. Big Brother Prime could show up at any moment."
4,3,0,Hordak,"Even you, Catra, should fear being this bold in my presence. I--"
4,3,0,Catra,"Pretty cook trick, huh? Lord Hordak, I'd like to introduce you to Double Trouble. They're our newest asset in taking down the Rebellion."
4,3,0,Double Trouble,Apologies for being rude. I was getting into character. Did it work? Be honest. I'm always open to constructive criticism.
4,3,0,Hordak,A shape-shifter. Impressive indeed. Do not attempt to deceive me again.
4,3,0,Catra,"So, what's all this about?"
4,3,0,Hordak,The bots were a part of the occupation of Elberon. A failed operation. The rebels seized the town. It seems their technological capabilities have increased since--Since Entrapta returned to them. It is of no consequence. I will improve our machines and we will seize Elberon back.
4,3,0,Catra,Elberon? Why?
4,3,0,Hordak,"It may have escaped your notice, but we are trying to win a war."
4,3,0,Catra,"See, you're thinking about this wrong. Elberon doesn't matter. It's what it can do for us that counts."
4,3,0,Hordak,And what do you propose?
4,3,0,Bow,"That's when Adora turned her sword into a giant spear, skewered a bot, and then used the bot to hit more bots."
4,3,0,Adora,"And then Bow used his slick oil arrow to slip them up, and then right off a cliff. Bam!"
4,3,0,Swift Wind,And I kicked them.
4,3,0,Glimmer,Yes! Get them.
4,3,0,Adora,But we were totally surrounded. And then...
4,3,0,Bow,My new surge device worked perfectly. Took out the rest of the bots in one go.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,And I kicked them.
4,3,0,Glimmer,"Amazing! These bots didn't stand a chance against the Best Friend Squad! I really wish I could've been there. At least you'll be back soon, right?"
4,3,0,Bow,Uh...Soon. Yeah. There's just one more thing we have to take care of.
4,3,0,Adora,Just some really boring wrap-up stuff.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"The people love us because we saved Elberon, so they're throwing us a celebratory dinner."
4,3,0,Glimmer,Heh. A dinner? That sounds fun.
4,3,0,Adora,"Oh, it's really not a big deal."
4,3,0,Bow,"Yeah, I mean I bet they do this for everyone."
4,3,0,Glimmer,"You guys, of course they wanna thank you. You freed a whole town from Horde control. I just..."
4,3,0,Adora,"Well, if you need us, we can totally skip out on this dinner thing."
4,3,0,Glimmer,No way. Go enjoy your victory.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"Great, because I am famished. Are we going now?"
4,3,0,Bow,"You really aren't missing anything. You know, we'll drop by to be polite and then head home."
4,3,0,Adora,Yep. I'm sure it'll be super boring.
4,3,0,Glimmer,What is it? What's going on?
4,3,0,Adora,Nothing. Super boring.
4,3,0,Bow,Gotta go. Wish you were here.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,Ooh.
4,3,0,Adora,It's a party.
4,3,0,Bow,It's a big party.
4,3,0,Adora,And it's for us.
4,3,0,Bow,It's a big party for us.
4,3,0,Adora,As individuals? Is that normal? Does this happen often?
4,3,0,Other,"Ah, there you are. Our heroes. Oh, we couldn't possibly thank you enough for liberating our town."
4,3,0,Adora,"We sort of do this a lot. You really, really didn't have to go through all this trouble."
4,3,0,Other,"It was supposed to be a small dinner. You know, a quiet meal, but then word got out and suddenly everyone's invited. So here we are. Rowdy, calling attention to ourselves, basically sitting targets."
4,3,0,Other,"What was that? Okay, okay. Terrifying booming sounds were probably a bad idea."
4,3,0,Other,She-Ra. You saved us.
4,3,0,Adora,"I mean, it's my job. It's what I do. It's...So it's not a big deal. At all."
4,3,0,Other,"And Tech Master Bow of the Rebellion. Oh, you have to show off your arrows to the kids. They're obsessed with them."
4,3,0,Bow,Really? Hey.
4,3,0,Other,"We've heard stories of your victories, but to see you destroy those bots in person? Mm. Amazing."
4,3,0,Other,That's nothing compared to when She-Ra took on the monsters of the Northern Reach. Or when she single-handedly won the Battle of Bright Moon.
4,3,0,Adora,"Oh, I wouldn't say single-handedly. I mean, I guess I--I guess I played kind of an important part."
4,3,0,Other,"Kind of important? Try huge. You fought off the Horde, you united the Princesses, and you saved Etheria, and you are the coolest."
4,3,0,Adora,"Uh, yeah, I mean, that was pretty cool, wasn't it?"
4,3,0,Other,"One day, I'm gonna leave Elberon and join the Rebellion, fighting side-by-side with you. I'm Flutterina, by the way. Oh! I'm shaking hands with She-Ra."
4,3,0,Adora,Can you believe this? All of this is for us. People like us. But we told Glimmer we wouldn't stay long.
4,3,0,Bow,"I mean, but we have to stay. It would be rude not to. Right?"
4,3,0,Adora,Right. We'll just stay for a minute and then-- Me cake! There's a me cake!
4,3,0,Bow,This is the best party ever.
4,3,0,Adora,"Yeah. This is so fun. They've got stories about me. Not some long ago She-Ra of the past. Me, and what I did."
4,3,0,Bow,"I know, right? This is awesome. We should rescue Elberon more often."
4,3,0,Other,It's the Horde.
4,3,0,Other,We must get the people to safety.
4,3,0,Other,"Our scouts have reported a bot. It's bigger than anything we've ever seen. It's on its way here. Oh, we need to evacuate the town. Now."
4,3,0,Adora,"Everyone, stay calm. You're under our protection. Let She-Ra handle this."
4,3,0,Other,She-Ra. She-Ra. She-Ra. She-Ra!
4,3,0,Other,We love you.
4,3,0,Other,"Are you sure we shouldn't prepare? As I always say, cautious today, here tomorrow."
4,3,0,Adora,"Don't worry. After all, it's my job and I'm pretty good at it. Enjoy the festivities."
4,3,0,Other,She-Ra. She-Ra.
4,3,0,Bow,Why do all of our parties have to end with the Horde attacking?
4,3,0,Adora,"Bow, it's okay. Stay here and watch the townspeople. There's no reason for the party to stop."
4,3,0,Bow,Are you sure?
4,3,0,Adora,"Swift Wind and I can deal with this. You heard the mayor, it's one bot. How tough can it be for She-Ra? Just stay and have fun. We'll be right back."
4,3,0,Swift Wind,She-Ra and Swift Wind forever. Uhh...That one's bigger than usual.
4,3,0,Adora,"Nothing we can't handle. Piece of cake, huh?"
4,3,0,Swift Wind,Does cake normally grow back and turn into more pieces of cake when you cut it?
4,3,0,Adora,Looks like these things can multiply. We need to be careful about how we destroy them.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,How do we carefully destroy something? Is it magical sacred bond time?
4,3,0,Adora,Can't say I'm too impressed with Hordak's new toys.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,Did it feel a little too easy to you?
4,3,0,Adora,"No, like they said in Elberon. We're awesome. Let's get back to the party. Hey everyone. Just wait until you hear about..."
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"Where did everyone go? Is this one of those parties Bow told us about where people hide and shout ""surprise""?"
4,3,0,Adora,"No, he said that happens before the party starts. Something's wrong."
4,3,0,Swift Wind,What was that?
4,3,0,Adora,There.
4,3,0,Other,Huh? You're back.
4,3,0,Adora,What happened here?
4,3,0,Other,"The Horde, it was awful. They attacked as soon as you left. Bow tried to fight, he's the only reason some people were able to escape. But they took him and everyone else."
4,3,0,Adora,That bot in the woods. It must have been a diversion so that I'd leave Elberon defenseless. And I fell for it. This is my fault. We need to find them.
4,3,0,Other,"I know I'm small and I'm not a Rebellion fighter, but I wanna help. So, can I come?"
4,3,0,Other,Are you okay?
4,3,0,Bow,I'll be fine.
4,3,0,Bow,Where are we? Where are my arrows?
4,3,0,Other,The soldiers took our weapons when they tossed us in here.
4,3,0,Other,We're doomed. What good is the Tech Master without his tech? Bow without his bow?
4,3,0,Other,We should have evacuated the town instead of listening to She-Ra.
4,3,0,Bow,"She-Ra and Swift Wind won't rest until they find us. But that doesn't mean we can't work on getting out of here. I'm still Bow the Tech Master, even without my arrows. I can get us out of this."
4,3,0,Scorpia,"Look at us. You and me in the field, side-by-side. Taking a bunch of random prisoners from a party, putting said prisoners in a big pit, guarding said pit. Ugh, if that doesn't say friendship, I don't know what does. The super pal duo is back."
4,3,0,Catra,What about the weapons we confiscated?
4,3,0,Scorpia,"Oh, yeah, you gotta see this. Huh? Huh? I know it's just cut up pieces of paper, but gosh, isn't it so much fun?"
4,3,0,Catra,We need to focus. She-Ra was in Elberon. Which means she's nearby.
4,3,0,Scorpia,Do you think she'll try some secret attack?
4,3,0,Catra,"Oh, I'm counting on it."
4,3,0,Scorpia,"Is that why you kidnapped everyone? Some plot against the Princess Alliance? I could help if I knew what you were up to. You know, like old times."
4,3,0,Catra,"It's a new strategy, okay? That's all you need to know."
4,3,0,Scorpia,"Oh, yeah, sure, sure, gotcha. Uh, feeling a little left out is all. You know, ever since that whole portal thing."
4,3,0,Catra,Get over it then.
4,3,0,Adora,"There's the guard post. If we can get inside, we can figure out where Bow and the others are being held."
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"How are we supposed to get in there without being seen? I mean, you're She-Ra. You don't exactly blend in. It's a side effect of being majestic."
4,3,0,Other,I think I have an idea.
4,3,0,Other,"Ahem. Oh, no. You've caught me. How will I ever get away? Oh, no."
4,3,0,Adora,This must be where they're keeping them.
4,3,0,Other,What do we do?
4,3,0,Adora,We save them. For the honor of Grayskull.
4,3,0,Other,Awesome.
4,3,0,Adora,"Wait, this doesn't make sense. The map says the pit would be here. We'll handle this. Stay out of sight."
4,3,0,Other,Okay.
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"Oh, yeah, they regenerate."
4,3,0,Adora,We forgot the bots regenerate.
4,3,0,Bow,"Ah. This isn't my first time in a Horde cell. Luckily, they didn't search you well enough. Can I borrow this? Yes."
4,3,0,Catra,"Hey, Adora. Took you long enough to show up."
4,3,0,Adora,Catra.
4,3,0,Catra,"Seriously. I thought I'd have to kidnap another town to get your attention. Oh, that's right, you were having a party. Must've thought you were pretty special."
4,3,0,Adora,"Can we skip the speech? I'm done playing your games Catra. Too many people got hurt when you set off that portal. I hope it was worth it, because I won't let you hurt my friends, or anyone else, ever again!"
4,3,0,Catra,You were the one who left the villagers unprotected. You're good enough at hurting your friends without my help. But you're still terrible at spotting traps.
4,3,0,Catra,"Pretty good, huh? I got the idea from Shadow Weaver. At least she was good for something in the end. If only your friends could see you now."
4,3,0,Bow,"No guards? Weird. All right, that's everyone. Now let's get out of here."
4,3,0,Other,Bow.
4,3,0,Bow,Flutterina? What are you doing here?
4,3,0,Other,It's She-Ra. She's in trouble and she needs help.
4,3,0,Catra,"You know, Adora, your whole self-righteous hero thing is getting old. At least I finally found a way to shut you up. Ow!"
4,3,0,Other,Hey. Get away from She-Ra.
4,3,0,Bow,Adora.
4,3,0,Catra,Aw. Looks like your friends came to watch. Why don't we put on a show for them?
4,3,0,Bow,We have to do something.
4,3,0,Other,Wait. Look.
4,3,0,Adora,Swift Wind.
4,3,0,Other,Three cheers for She-Ra!
4,3,0,Adora,Thank you. We couldn't have gotten out without you guys.
4,3,0,Bow,Thank Flutterina. It was her quick thinking that saved us.
4,3,0,Other,"I know you think I'm just a kid, but I'm ready to join the Rebellion. I wanna fight the Horde and keep my people safe, like She-Ra."
4,3,0,Adora,The Rebellion could use someone brave and clever like you. We'd be honored.
4,3,0,Other,Thank you. Thank you so much.
4,3,0,Scorpia,"Catra, there you are. Are you okay? Don't worry about that Adora stuff. I'm here and there's nothing we can't fix, because that's what friends are for. I'm sure Hordak will understand. Oh. If Entrapta was here maybe we could--"
4,3,0,Catra,"Stop it! Stop badgering me, Stop hovering over me, Just back off! I don't need to explain myself to you, We're not friends! Oh, and Scorpia? Keep Emily out of my sight or I'll sell her for scrap. Understand?"
4,3,0,Swift Wind,"Sacred bond, saving the day."
4,3,0,Other,"I'm joining the Rebellion. Can you believe it? Me, Flutterina. This is the most exciting day of my life."
4,3,0,Bow,You okay?
4,3,0,Adora,"Ugh. I put everyone in danger because I thought I could handle everything by myself. I was so excited that everyone was treating me like a hero, I forgot to act like one."
4,3,0,Bow,Hey. Elberon's safe and we got a new recruit for the Rebellion.
4,3,0,Adora,"You're right. I couldn't have done it without you. Thanks, Bow."
4,3,0,Bow,Anytime. Now let's go home.
4,3,0,Hordak,Did it work?
4,3,0,Catra,Like a charm. The plan is under way.
4,3,0,Adora,Welcome to Bright Moon.
4,3,0,Catra,Those idiots won't know what hit them.
4,4,0,Adora,Now.
4,4,0,Netossa,"Boom, nets."
4,4,0,Adora,"Everyone, be ready. Our scouts reported the Horde is transporting a new prototype weapon. And they wouldn't brave the Whispering Woods unless it was something powerful."
4,4,0,Bow,"If I know Entrapta, this thing is gonna be big, unpredictable and...invisible. Genius. Or it's just empty."
4,4,0,Adora,But our scouts said Catra would be moving the weapon today. It's supposed to be here.
4,4,0,Netossa,It's an ambush.
4,4,0,Glimmer,I don't understand how this happened.
4,4,0,Other,The Horde must have figured out we were going after the transport and laid a trap.
4,4,0,Netossa,Ooh.
4,4,0,Adora,Uhh--
4,4,0,Glimmer,Are you all okay?
4,4,0,Bow,Never been better.
4,4,0,Bow,"Okay, we've been slightly better."
4,4,0,Glimmer,"How do they keep doing this? No matter where I send you, the Horde always shows up to ruin the mission. And I'm just sitting here, I--"
4,4,0,Adora,"It's okay, Glimmer. Everyone knows you're needed in Bright Moon."
4,4,0,Bow,"So, what's the plan?"
4,4,0,Swift Wind,Did someone say Swift Wind? Swift-- Hang on. Did someone say--?
4,4,0,Glimmer,No one said Swift Wind.
4,4,0,Swift Wind,"But you just did. Anyway, I backtracked down the path the transport was on. It came from the mountains, on the far side of Bright Moon."
4,4,0,Bow,That could be where they're keeping the weapon. We have to investigate.
4,4,0,Other,A smaller team will avoid detection. Get in and out before the Horde even knows you're there.
4,4,0,Glimmer,I hate sending you guys back out.
4,4,0,Adora,"Hey. Whatever this is, we need to destroy it before it's used on innocent people. Right, guys?"
4,4,0,Netossa,Count us in.
4,4,0,Other,"Darling, your arm."
4,4,0,Netossa,"Uh-huh? Nice try. Spinnerella refuses to accept that I busted two more bots than she did, so I'm winning."
4,4,0,Other,There is nothing to win--
4,4,0,Adora,"So, uh, hey, how about we take this conversation to the War Room? We've got a mission to plan."
4,4,0,Swift Wind,Great. Let's go.
4,4,0,Other,"Oh, sorry, Your Majesty."
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Sorry, Flutterina, I didn't see you."
4,4,0,Other,"Oh, it's okay. Are you guys going on a mission? Can I come?"
4,4,0,Glimmer,Not this time. And not all of us are going.
4,4,0,Other,"Next time, then. Rebellion Soldier Flutterina is ready. Have fun."
4,4,0,Catra,"I can't get over how ridiculous you look, ""Flutterina."""
4,4,0,Other,"Right? I said to myself, ""Double Trouble, what sort of character would the Princesses trust?"" Someone tooth-achingly cute and pink."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Then it came to me, Flutterina. A role for the--"
4,4,0,Catra,"Yeah, great, whatever. Is there any news?"
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Your team did quite a number on the Rebels. They came limping back in, so despondent, such emotion. Oh! It was breathtaking."
4,4,0,Catra,"Your intel was good, but they still got away."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Espionage is a long game, kitten. The Rebels are tired, demoralized. And you should've seen Glimmer's face when she realized she'd been outsmarted again."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"How is the Horde always two steps ahead? Angry sparkle, growl."
4,4,0,Catra,And any intel on She-Ra? Or are we done here?
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"So serious. Remember, this is supposed to be fun."
4,4,0,Catra,This is supposed to be war.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,No reason it can't be both.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"All business, no fun. She-Ra's putting together a team to track down Hordak's new weapon."
4,4,0,Catra,She-Ra's not going to find anything. But they'll all see the weapon when the time comes.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,Ooh. Foreshadowing. Love this.
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,Impressive.
4,4,0,Glimmer,Huh? What are you doing here?
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,I've come to tend my garden.
4,4,0,Glimmer,You've got to be kidding me. You're gardening? You?
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,"One must keep oneself occupied. Your power is truly a sight to behold. It's no wonder, you being Micah's daughter. I'd never seen a sorcerer like him."
4,4,0,Glimmer,"I get it. I'm the daughter of an angelic being and a powerful sorcerer, and I'll never be as good as either of them."
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,That's true. You'll be better. Don't you remember your raw magical energy when we invaded the Fright Zone together?
4,4,0,Glimmer,I remember you draining me.
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,Yes. But I did help you become more powerful.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Well, luckily, I don't need your help for that anymore."
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,"No, I suppose not. Of course, it's all wasted if you don't use it. I've been watching you. You're trying to be like your mother, overseeing things from afar. But you are not her. You must decide for yourself what kind of queen you will be."
4,4,0,Glimmer,And I've decided. I'm a queen who doesn't take advice from prisoners.
4,4,0,Adora,"Stay close, and stay quiet."
4,4,0,Netossa,"Just for the record, I'm being way quieter than you--"
4,4,0,Bow,"Guys, do you hear something?"
4,4,0,Other,It's an ambush. Again.
4,4,0,Netossa,This one's mine. Ha! Two for one. Still winning.
4,4,0,Adora,Is...Is that the new weapon?
4,4,0,Swift Wind,It's not very big. Or move-y.
4,4,0,Bow,It could be a surveillance bot.
4,4,0,Adora,Bow? Bow!
4,4,0,Bow,Did we win?
4,4,0,Glimmer,Bow. Thank goodness. I was so scared.
4,4,0,Bow,I feel like we didn't win.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Bow, are you okay?"
4,4,0,Bow,"Don't worry about me. I'm fine. I'm just, you know, gonna lie here for a bit."
4,4,0,Glimmer,Why is he not okay?
4,4,0,Adora,"Even with healing, he's still going to need some time to recover."
4,4,0,Glimmer,I can't keep sending my friends into ambushes. How does the Horde know our every move?
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I hate to suggest it, but could they be tracking She-Ra?"
4,4,0,Glimmer,That could explain how they always know where you are.
4,4,0,Adora,Bow...I'm sorry. It's my fault you got hurt.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"No. This is Catra's fault. Her, and her bots, and--and me. I sent you out, knowing it was dangerous, while I stayed here, safe and sound."
4,4,0,Bow,Don't worry about me. I'm the one who worries about you. Can we go back to that? Please?
4,4,0,Adora,I'm going back to find that bot and destroy it.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"No. If the Horde is tracking you, they're gonna be ready. What if--?"
4,4,0,Adora,"Glimmer, you said it yourself. We can't risk more people getting hurt. General?"
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Don't worry, Bow. I'm gonna take care of this."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,Catra. I knew you were behind this.
4,4,0,Catra,Ugh.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Oh, no, the new weapon! It's firing. It got me in the abs. The most vulnerable part of the body that I refuse to cover, because I don't own real shirts."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"If only I was there to sparkle at it. Oh, Bow!"
4,4,0,Double Trouble,Glimmer!
4,4,0,Double Trouble,She-Ra!
4,4,0,Catra,Show me She-Ra again.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,I'm She-Ra.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,Ah. There it is.
4,4,0,Catra,There what is?
4,4,0,Double Trouble,The thrill of seeding destruction and chaos.
4,4,0,Catra,Ahem. I'll be thrilled if the Pulsebot really blew that dummy up.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Sadly, Bow's been healed by some glowy magic. Very dramatic stuff."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Oh, cheer up. I'm sending coordinates for She-Ra's position. She's going back out to destroy the bot that hurt her friend."
4,4,0,Catra,"Ugh. Typical heroic Adora plan. Too bad we'll be gone by the time she gets there. But if it's to take down She-Ra, I think we could stand a delay."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,I knew there was a reason I liked you. Having fun yet?
4,4,0,Catra,"You know, I think I am."
4,4,0,Glimmer,Give us a minute. That's an order. I need--The Queen demands your help.
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,I see. And what is it I can do?
4,4,0,Glimmer,"You know Catra best. She's been two steps ahead this entire time. Show me how to think like she does, so I can figure out her next move before anyone else gets hurt."
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,You don't need to think like Catra. I told you you're more powerful than you know. Are you willing to use your power?
4,4,0,Glimmer,"And how, hypothetically, would I do that?"
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,"Magic, of course. A location spell is a simple but powerful tool for any young sorcerer. All it takes is a few ingredients...and the will to see it through."
4,4,0,Glimmer,You've been growing magic plants this whole time? What do these do?
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,"Those are daisies. I find them cheerful. Now, the final ingredient, added by the spellcaster."
4,4,0,Glimmer,Did I do that?
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,Think about what you're searching for. Keep it in your mind.
4,4,0,Glimmer,A secret outpost. The Horde has been operating out of the Whispering Woods this whole time.
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,Well done.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Oh, no. Adora's looking in the wrong place. If we can warn her in time, we can send her to the outpost and stop Catra once and for all. But if Catra's tracking She-Ra, she'll know we're coming and clear out before we get there."
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,Catra won't be expecting an attack. Her attention will be focused on Adora. It would be the perfect time to strike.
4,4,0,Glimmer,Are you suggesting I use Adora as bait?
4,4,0,Shadow Weaver,"As a distraction. But the decision is yours alone to make. What will you do, Your Majesty?"
4,4,0,Other,I don't see any sign of the Horde.
4,4,0,Adora,I can take it from here. I'm not leaving until I destroy this bot.
4,4,0,Other,No. Princesses stick together. We'll find it.
4,4,0,Netossa,"Ha. You wanna fight some bots. See, Adora? She is just as competitive as I am."
4,4,0,Other,"See, this is why no one comes to game night anymore. Adora, tell her."
4,4,0,Adora,"Oh, I don't--"
4,4,0,Netossa,"Maybe people don't come to game night because you insist on serving vegetable platters. No one likes vegetable platters. Right, Adora?"
4,4,0,Adora,Fall back!
4,4,0,Catra,What are you doing back--?
4,4,0,Catra,Oh. It's you.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Who else would it be? Didn't anyone ever teach you to put away your toys? Otherwise, someone might come and break them."
4,4,0,Catra,You don't think I have more?
4,4,0,Glimmer,"I think most of your bots are busy with She-Ra, leaving you defenseless."
4,4,0,Catra,"Using your own friend as a decoy? Wow, didn't know you had it in you."
4,4,0,Glimmer,Guess you don't know everything.
4,4,0,Catra,You even taste like glitter.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Where are you going, Catra? Not scared of some sparkles, are you?"
4,4,0,Catra,"The Pulsebots are out vaporizing your friends, but I bet you'd like to see our upgrade. We were saving it for a special occasion, but this'll do."
4,4,0,Glimmer,You're going to bring the whole place down.
4,4,0,Catra,"Don't worry. I'm not planning to stick around. It's revving up to send out a pulse strong enough to level half the woods. So you'd better choose. Me, or the bot?"
4,4,0,Glimmer,Looks like I don't have to.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,Word around Bright Moon was that the Queen had disappeared on a mission. I thought I'd come check on you.
4,4,0,Catra,Double Trouble. About time.
4,4,0,Netossa,I don't know how long I can do this.
4,4,0,Adora,Glimmer?
4,4,0,Glimmer,Thought you could use some help.
4,4,0,Adora,Whoa.
4,4,0,Netossa,"Spinnerella! Spinnerella, please, talk to me."
4,4,0,Other,Fourteen.
4,4,0,Netossa,What?
4,4,0,Other,That was 14 bots for me. I win.
4,4,0,Netossa,That's my girl. You win.
4,4,0,Glimmer,Should I start counting too? Because...I got the rest.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"You should've seen me out there, Bow. I was like..."
4,4,0,Bow,"Sounds really cool. But also, really awful?"
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Ugh. Come on, guys. Can't we just enjoy this victory?"
4,4,0,Adora,This isn't over. We still need to figure out how the Horde is tracking me.
4,4,0,Glimmer,"But until we do, at least we can use it to our advantage."
4,4,0,Adora,By using me as a decoy?
4,4,0,Glimmer,"I know it was dangerous. But it was the only chance I had to take out the rest of the bots before Catra could unleash them. And it worked. I'm not gonna stay behind anymore. That's not the kind of queen I am. I wanna be out there, fighting to protect my kingdom. Side by side with my best friends. And now that Shadow Weaver's teaching me magic, I'll be twice as effective."
4,4,0,Adora,What? Shadow Weaver's teaching you?
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Guys. We won today, and no one else got hurt. That's what counts."
4,4,0,Bow,"Glimmer, I don't know--"
4,4,0,Glimmer,"Now, I'm gonna go raid the kitchen in celebration."
4,4,0,Adora,Glimmer.
4,4,0,Glimmer,I'll bring back some cake.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Here's your stop, kitten. What are you going to tell your boss about all his shiny new bots getting blown up?"
4,4,0,Catra,"I'm going to say, ""You're welcome for testing them before we moved ahead with our big plan. Obviously they were garbage."" Hey, thank you, by the way for saving me. I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't shown up."
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Well, I live to serve. For a price, of course. Marvelous. And don't worry, darling. I'll keep a better eye on Glimmer. Who knew she was so powerful?"
4,4,0,Catra,Heh. Whatever. If she hadn't used Adora as bait.
4,4,0,Double Trouble,"Oh, yes. How devious. I'd assumed she was all glitter, no grit."
4,4,0,Catra,"Yeah, that was unexpected. And then she showed up alone. Huh. Looks like the friendship might have a few cracks, huh? Would be a shame if someone were there to take advantage of them."
4,5,0,Kyle,Ow!
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Will you stop messing around back there, Kyle? We're almost out of these creepy woods."
4,5,0,Adora,This is kind of fun.
4,5,0,Light Hope,You are not taking your training seriously.
4,5,0,Adora,What? Me? That doesn't sound like me.
4,5,0,Light Hope,Adora.
4,5,0,Adora,"Ugh. Come on, Light Hope. It's not like I'm learning anything new here."
4,5,0,Light Hope,Then I must offer more hands-on instruction. There is a bot behind--
4,5,0,Adora,Am I done now?
4,5,0,Light Hope,I sense resistance.
4,5,0,Adora,"Because this is useless. I don't need more training. I need answers. We're fighting a war, and the Horde has been one step ahead at every turn. Glimmer thinks that they're tracking She-Ra somehow. Is it because my sword is First Ones tech? Or because I'm a First One? And what does that even mean? Who were they? When we found Mara's ship, she left a recording behind--"
4,5,0,Light Hope,Adora. Mara was compromised. She became unhinged.
4,5,0,Adora,"She didn't seem unhinged. She seemed scared. And she was talking about a weapon. If there's something that can protect us from the Horde, I need to know about it."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Once you balance the planet, all will be clear. It is your purpose as She--She--She--She--She--She--She--She--She--"
4,5,0,Adora,"Oh, wow. Really? Way to avoid the subject."
4,5,0,Lonnie,Catra better appreciate us going behind enemy lines to get this armor plating stuff for her.
4,5,0,Kyle,Guys? Are we home?
4,5,0,Adora,Stupid glitchy door.
4,5,0,Light Hope,That is not the Sword of Protection's intended purpose.
4,5,0,Adora,"Yeah, well, if you're not gonna tell me anything, I'm leaving."
4,5,0,Light Hope,You cannot leave. My senses have detected a fluke spore cloud blooming in the Whispering Woods. It is not safe outside.
4,5,0,Adora,"Well, that's convenient. You want me to stay here, so you can not answer more of my questions?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,Adora.
4,5,0,Adora,Light Hope! Light Hope?
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Hello, my name is Light Hope. How may I assist you?"
4,5,0,Adora,What's going on?
4,5,0,Light Hope,"My system is rebooting. I would like to answer your query, but the information as to what is going on has not yet loaded. Who are you?"
4,5,0,Kyle,We shouldn't have come through the Whispering Woods. It's not safe.
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Well, obviously Catra felt it was worth risking us to get this cargo back sooner."
4,5,0,Kyle,It's attacking! Stand back. I'll handle it.
4,5,0,Lonnie,What is this stuff?
4,5,0,Kyle,"Oh. Oh, it's actually kind of pretty. Like snow."
4,5,0,Kyle,It's hurting! I made a mistake!
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Will you quit it, Kyle?"
4,5,0,Lonnie,Why didn't you say it hurts?
4,5,0,Lonnie,"I know, Rogelio. One of us has gotta go back outside and fix the transport."
4,5,0,Kyle,"Uh, uh...But outside hurts."
4,5,0,Lonnie,Then we'll just have to stay in here and wait out whatever is happening.
4,5,0,Kyle,What? We'll be trapped in here? Maybe for hours or days? With only each other for company? And we won't be able to get back to the Fright Zone? This is great.
4,5,0,Kyle,Seriously. The Fright Zone's been so stressful lately. Out here we don't have to worry about Catra showing up and yelling at--
4,5,0,Catra,Where are you? You were supposed to be back an hour ago.
4,5,0,Kyle,"Uh...Uh...Well, the woods are attacking us with very painful snow."
4,5,0,Catra,Why is he talking?
4,5,0,Lonnie,There's some sort of weird acid storm happening out there. But we're assessing the situation.
4,5,0,Catra,"Assess faster. Hordak needs that armor plating from the rebel mine, now. The plan can't fall behind schedule."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Well, maybe if you told us what this big plan is, we could help you--"
4,5,0,Catra,"I doubt that, seeing as you failed to do the one thing I asked."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Hey. It's not our fault. The transport broke down, and it's too dangerous to go out there."
4,5,0,Catra,"I don't care! I gave you an order. Pick someone, send them outside, and fix it. Now. Understand? Well?"
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Yes, Force Captain Catra."
4,5,0,Kyle,Not it.
4,5,0,Adora,"What do you mean, who am I? Light Hope?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,The Light Hope operating system is attempting to reload. Please stand by. I am pleased to report that my system is now at 22 percent. Oh! I have just learned how to move about the castle.
4,5,0,Adora,Okay there. You seem like you're having fun. Uh...Light Hope?
4,5,0,Light Hope,My personality profile has not fully loaded. Am I not usually fun?
4,5,0,Adora,"Oh, no. No, no. I've never seen you like this."
4,5,0,Light Hope,I have also never seen you like this. Because your identity has not yet loaded. Who are you?
4,5,0,Adora,"Uh, Adora. But I'm, you know... She-Ra."
4,5,0,Light Hope,My primary purpose is to train She-Ra. How may I assist you?
4,5,0,Adora,"Well, just before rebooting, you were gonna tell me all about this weapon Mara mentioned, and about where I come from, and about everything I've ever wanted to know."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Of course. I will answer all of you questions. But that information has not yet loaded. I did, however, just learn how to control gravity in the Crystal Castle."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"That is not right. Do not worry, I will fix it."
4,5,0,Adora,"No, no, no."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Okay, here's the situation. One of us has to brave the acid snow, go out there, and fix the transport. So we're gonna choose who goes outside fair and square...with a game of bot-shield-laser."
4,5,0,Kyle,"Wait, how come you get to decide what game we play?"
4,5,0,Lonnie,Because I'm clearly the leader.
4,5,0,Lonnie,See? Rogelio agrees.
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Oh, pipe down. We go on three. One, two, three. Let's try that again. One, two, three."
4,5,0,Light Hope,Apologies. You appear to be in pain. Should I adjust the gravity again?
4,5,0,Adora,"No. Has your system loaded anything about Mara's weapon yet? Or, you know, anything useful?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,Are spiders useful? Because I have just learned how to make spiders.
4,5,0,Adora,"No, they're not. Get rid of them, please."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"I am so sorry, but that information has not yet loaded."
4,5,0,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
4,5,0,Kyle,"Yes! Shield beats bot. Uh, but, Lonnie your laser beats shield, so...So you win?"
4,5,0,Kyle,"Except Rogelio's bot beat laser...Okay, so I beat Rogelio, but you beat me, and Rogelio beat you. That means...we're all winners."
4,5,0,Lonnie,That means this isn't working. We need a new game.
4,5,0,Kyle,Ooh. I have an idea.
4,5,0,Adora,It would be really good if your system could finish loading now.
4,5,0,Light Hope,"I agree. However, my reboot appears to have malfunctioned. Loading is frozen at 36 percent. We must manually override the system to bring my programming fully online."
4,5,0,Adora,How do we do that? And how can we do it fast?
4,5,0,Light Hope,We must connect this data crystal to the core processing unit. I made a crystal.
4,5,0,Adora,So where is the core processing unit? And please don't say--
4,5,0,Light Hope,It is on the other side of these spiders.
4,5,0,Light Hope,Do not worry. I will assist you. Apologies. I made more spiders. Oh! I know what will help.
4,5,0,Adora,"No, don't--"
4,5,0,Light Hope,I simulated the ocean. Spiders cannot swim.
4,5,0,Adora,What the--?
4,5,0,Kyle,Perfect score. Ah? Ah? Try to beat that.
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Okay, wait a minute. When Rogelio bounced it off of that thing, you said it was minus five points."
4,5,0,Kyle,"Mm-hm, mm-hm. Yes. He forgot the magic password, and he's standing in the loser zone. And Lonnie, you're not wearing the hat, so that's another five-point deduction for you."
4,5,0,Lonnie,What? These rules don't even make any sense.
4,5,0,Kyle,"You're just a sore loser. Now, watch the master."
4,5,0,Lonnie,Hey! Watch out!
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Kyle, did you just lose the game that you made up?"
4,5,0,Kyle,"Uh... No. No, that's a different move, and I get all the points and I win."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Oh, uh-uh. No way. Not happening."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Apologies, She-Ra. I did not know that humans cannot swim. However, you will note that I did get rid of the spiders."
4,5,0,Adora,I can swim. I just can't breathe under water.
4,5,0,Light Hope,Interesting. I shall make a note of this.
4,5,0,Adora,Well it's not the ocean. I'll give you that. What's happening?
4,5,0,Light Hope,It seems that the spore storm outside has worsened. It is compromising the Crystal Castle.
4,5,0,Adora,"Don't tell me the information for how to stop that hasn't loaded yet. We need to get to the processing unit, now."
4,5,0,Light Hope,Place it in the left slot.
4,5,0,Adora,Are you sure?
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Yes. Of course my system is only at 36 percent, so I suppose I am 36 percent sure."
4,5,0,Adora,Perfect.
4,5,0,Light Hope,It is in fact far from perfect.
4,5,0,Adora,I was being sarcastic.
4,5,0,Light Hope,"What is ""sarcastic""?"
4,5,0,Adora,"Oh, trust me, that information is never gonna load for you."
4,5,0,Light Hope,Oh.
4,5,0,Adora,"What? So, is everything reset now? Can you finish telling me about the weapon and Mara?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Hello, my name is Light Hope. How may I assist you?"
4,5,0,Kyle,Guys? Do you think anybody's gonna come and save us?
4,5,0,Lonnie,Nobody is coming. We gotta save ourselves. And we better pick someone to fix the transport soon or Catra is gonna kill us. I don't even know why we bother. She doesn't trust us. She's obsessed with this big plan. It's the only thing that matters to her.
4,5,0,Kyle,"Don't say that. Look, she may be mean, but we've always had each other's backs ever since we were kids. She probably sent us on this mission for, like, team-building."
4,5,0,Kyle,You guys are the only family I've ever had. Even Catra. Remember when she used my ration bars to make that cake for Adora?
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Uh, that never happened. That was the weird fake portal reality."
4,5,0,Kyle,"Wait, what? But we're a unit."
4,5,0,Lonnie,You wanna know what we really are? We're expendable. Catra doesn't care about us. Adora left us. Everything they taught us in the Horde about loyalty is meaningless. It's everyone for themselves.
4,5,0,Kyle,"Fine. Nothing matters, I guess. Then I'll do it. I'll fix the transport, so I don't have to be stuck in here with my non-friends anymore."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Oh, knock it off, Kyle."
4,5,0,Kyle,"You knock it off, Kyle."
4,5,0,Lonnie,What? That doesn't even make any sense.
4,5,0,Kyle,Nothing makes sense anymore.
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Ugh. Kyle, quit fooling around. Will you help me out here?"
4,5,0,Lonnie,Me? This isn't my fault. Rogelio.
4,5,0,Adora,Please tell me that this time all your information has loaded.
4,5,0,Light Hope,I am back to full functionality. Disregard. That was incorrect. My system reboot is still only at 36 percent. Look. I made a bird.
4,5,0,Adora,"Of course, it was the wrong slot. I don't know what I expected. Even when you do know everything, you don't tell me anything. You are useless! Oh, Light Hope, I'm..."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"I am a hologram. My primary purpose is to train She-Ra. If I am not doing that, then I have failed. I am sorry, Adora."
4,5,0,Adora,"Wait, Light Hope. Light Hope?"
4,5,0,Mara,Light Hope. Light Hope. Look what I brought you.
4,5,0,Mara,"Flowers. They're blooming all over the planet right now. Here, smell."
4,5,0,Light Hope,I have no olfactory sensors. I cannot smell.
4,5,0,Mara,"They're pretty, though, right?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,Pretty. Yes. They are aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for bringing them.
4,5,0,Mara,"I thought they might liven the place up. I mean, it must be hard being stuck in here all the time."
4,5,0,Light Hope,I do not mind. Not when you come to visit me.
4,5,0,Light Hope,I looked at my loaded data banks to see if I could find the answers you seek. All I have on Mara is this memory and a sensation. Warmth. Her memory brings me warmth.
4,5,0,Adora,You and Mara were close?
4,5,0,Light Hope,Yes. We were. Are we not close?
4,5,0,Adora,"It's just that you keep things from me. I know it's in an everything-will-make-sense-in-time kind of way, but it's also pretty annoying."
4,5,0,Light Hope,"""Annoying."" This word has not yet loaded. Is it good?"
4,5,0,Adora,No.
4,5,0,Light Hope,"I did not think so. It is my role to watch over She-Ra. I want to serve She-Ra, to protect her to the best of my abilities. But sometimes, those abilities are not enough."
4,5,0,Adora,"Sometimes I feel that way too. I'm sorry about Mara, and I'm...I'm sorry I'm not her. But we could be friends too, if you want."
4,5,0,Light Hope,Friends. Yes. I would like that.
4,5,0,Adora,"Come on, let's get you fixed."
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Okay, you made your point, Kyle. Now turn around. That's an or--"
4,5,0,Lonnie,"We shouldn't have let him go out alone. The armor plating? Oh, Catra will kill us if it's damaged."
4,5,0,Adora,You promise this other slot is the right one?
4,5,0,Light Hope,I am 36 percent sure.
4,5,0,Adora,It'll have to do. Feeling better?
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Reboot complete. Hello, Adora. The spore cloud has dissipated. It is safe for you to leave."
4,5,0,Adora,"What, you don't wanna hang out with me anymore?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,What would we hang from?
4,5,0,Adora,"Come on, we just saved the Crystal Castle."
4,5,0,Light Hope,There is still the matter of balancing the planet.
4,5,0,Adora,"I know that you're just trying to protect me, but now that we're friends, you know you can trust me with the truth about everything, right?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,"Once you balance the planet, all will become clear."
4,5,0,Adora,We'll get there.
4,5,0,Kyle,You came for me. You do care.
4,5,0,Lonnie,We just knew you were gonna mess it up like you always do. Okay?
4,5,0,Kyle,"Hey, you, you too, buddy. Probably?"
4,5,0,Lonnie,"Alright, we've gotta get back to the Fright Zone. Just keep your leg elevated till then."
4,5,0,Mara,"They're pretty, though, right?"
4,5,0,Light Hope,Pretty. Yes. They are aesthetically pleasing. Thank you for bringing them.
4,5,0,Mara,I thought they might liven the place up. It must be hard being stuck in here all the time.
4,5,0,Light Hope,I do not mind. Not when you come to visit me.
4,5,0,Light Hope,This memory should have been purged per directive of the Heart of Etheria Project. Permantly delete.
4,6,0,Scorpia,"Good morning, world! Force Captain Scorpia, reporting for duty! Wake up: check. Looking sharp: check. Breathe in new day: check. Make bed: check. Feed Emily, although I'm still not sure that you eat...: check."
4,6,0,Scorpia,"Whoa, hey! Careful there. Cool, right? Catra gave it to me in the Crimson Waste. She's got a matching one, it's like, our thing, you know?"
4,6,0,Scorpia,"I know, I know, she said we're not friends anymore...but she didn't mean it. And maybe I misheard her, there was a lot going on. There was a cannon. Push down doubts and insecurities: check."
4,6,0,Scorpia,"I am brave, strong, loyal, and give great hugs. And I am going to be the best friend that I CAN BE!"
4,6,0,Scorpia,Yep. Today will be a great day!
4,6,1,Glimmer,You dropped one!
4,6,1,Adora,My bad!
4,6,1,Bow,"Watch your step! At this rate, we'll have the supply line open in no time. Just hang back."
4,6,1,Other,Looking for this?
4,6,1,Glimmer,This one's mine.
4,6,1,Glimmer,Looks like it's your lucky day. I've got this rune I've really wanted to try out.
4,6,1,Glimmer,Hey! I had that one!
4,6,1,Adora,"You are the Queen. I can't let anything happen to you. Besides, whatever dark magic Shadow Weaver taught you obviously doesn't seem to be doing the job..."
4,6,1,Glimmer,It's not dark magic. And it would have been really cool if it had worked!
4,6,1,Bow,"Aw, you guys! Look at us! The Best Friend Squad back together again!"
4,6,1,Other,"Whoo! Take that, Horde! Best first Rebellion mission ever! Thank you so much for letting me come."
4,6,1,Glimmer,This can't be all of them. Where's the rest? There aren't even any bots.
4,6,1,Other,I didn't see any others. They probably ran away scared.
4,6,1,Adora,All right! We should head out. We've still got another outpost to shut down before we can re-open supply lines to the Kingdom of Snows. Come on! Let's move.
4,6,1,Other,Wasn't She-Ra amazing in that battle? You are so lucky she saved you before that Horde soldier reached you.
4,6,1,Glimmer,She didn't save me! I was...doing...a thing.
4,6,1,Other,"Oh, right. I mean, your little magic trick would've been really cool if it had worked! Anyway, your real strength is in teamwork! And the way you let Adora give you orders even though you're the Queen, I-I--"
4,6,1,Glimmer,She wasn't giving me orders. We're a team!
4,6,1,Other,"The greatest team! That's why she can talk to you like that, all, ""I'm She-Ra, I know best!"", but you stay friends. What a bond..."
4,6,1,Other,"Like lambs to the slaughter... Hey, guys! Wait for me!"
4,6,2,Hordak,The Rebellion is dismantling our northern perimeter. Why are our outposts unprepared for an attack?
4,6,2,Catra,Because they're skeleton crews. I've called back the main defenses.
4,6,2,Hordak,What? Why?
4,6,2,Catra,"Okay... The princesses have no idea what's coming. Let them waste their time on some useless outposts. We are saving our resources for the big mission. The final part of our plan, remember? It's almost time."
4,6,2,Hordak,We're...not ready. I need more time to complete the weapon.
4,6,2,Catra,We've put everything into this plan. We don't have more time.
4,6,2,Hordak,"This technology...is based on Entrapta's research, but I've reached a dead-end. I need her notes...her recordings. They must hold the key to making this work..."
4,6,2,Catra,Entrapta is a traitor.
4,6,2,Hordak,"You think I don't know that?! This is what she left behind. And this is what I will use to defeat every last princess on Etheria. Horde Prime will be here soon, and when he arrives he will see what I am capable of... I will return to his side--victorious...worthy. But first... I need. Those. Recordings."
4,6,3,Scorpia,"Emily! You know you're supposed to stay in my room. Ya little scamp. Come on, no guilt trip, it's for your own good. We can't let Catra see you, and right now? I'm bringing her a cup of my famous soothing tea. ...Old family recipe. If anyone could use a pick-me-up, it's Catra."
4,6,3,Scorpia,Go on.
4,6,3,Scorpia,"Aaah, okay, you can come. Can't say no to that cute little face."
4,6,3,Scorpia,"Hey, I said you can come, where are you--"
4,6,3,Catra,Who are you talking to?
4,6,3,Scorpia,"Catra! Oh! Hot! Okay, boy, you can really sneak up on a gal. ...Oh, are--are you okay? You don't look so good, I--have you been getting enough sleep? ...Here. I made you some--"
4,6,3,Catra,"I didn't ask for your opinion. I have a job for you. I need you to find Entrapta's recordings, you know, that thingy she was always babbling into."
4,6,3,Scorpia,You want...Entrapta's recordings? Does this mean--
4,6,3,Catra,"It means...that Hordak needs them. I'm so close. If I can pull this off, everything, everything will have been worth it. Find me those recordings so I can finish this."
4,6,3,Scorpia,"Yes! Yes, I'll find them. I-I promise. D-Did you want any of the...tea? ...You know what, it's not a--"
4,6,3,Catra,What are you still doing here?!
4,6,4,Scorpia,"See, Emily? What did I tell you? Catra just needed a loyal friend. I'll find those recordings, she'll do her mission, and then she can relax, and things will go back to normal."
4,6,4,Lonnie,Scorpia! A little help?
4,6,4,Scorpia,"Hey, guys! Can't stay long. I'm on a super important, top-secret mission for Catra."
4,6,4,Lonnie,Good luck with that. I'm sure Catra will be super grateful.
4,6,4,Scorpia,"Uh, yeah. Of course she'll be grateful. Everything Catra's done has been to help the Horde. And if we stick with her, keep doing our jobs...I'm sure she'll notice. ...You know...e-eventually..."
4,6,4,Lonnie,"Yeah, right. Our guys are getting attacked on the northern perimeter...and Catra's letting it happen. She doesn't care about any of us."
4,6,4,Scorpia,"No. No, you're wrong. Catra's been...under a lot of pressure...and maybe she just..."
4,6,4,Lonnie,When are you gonna wake up?! ...Hey! We were supposed to be loading these onto the transport. Scorpia... just get out of here. We've got real work to do.
4,6,4,Scorpia,"Good idea. You go do your job, and I'll do mine. Just a...well-oiled machine..."
4,6,5,Bow,"I don't see any defensive bots here, either. Honestly, it doesn't look like there's anyone on watch."
4,6,5,Adora,"But we don't know what they've got inside the outpost, so let's go in nice and slow. Here's what we're gonna do...I-- Glimmer!"
4,6,5,Adora,"Glimmer, what are you doing? You can't just rush into battle on your own like that, you're the Queen! You're too valuable."
4,6,5,Glimmer,Am I the Queen? Because it seems like you're the one giving all the orders.
4,6,5,Adora,And what's your plan? More dark magic?
4,6,5,Glimmer,"It's not dark magic! And I don't know, maybe if it helps me do what needs to be done!"
4,6,5,Adora,"Magic won't fix everything, you know!"
4,6,5,Glimmer,What good is magic if I can't use it!
4,6,5,Other,"Double Trouble, sometimes you're too good..."
4,6,5,Adora,--you have us for!
4,6,5,Glimmer,I don't need you guys to save me! Stop treating me like I'm weak and let me make my own decisions!
4,6,5,Adora,We're just looking out for you!
4,6,5,Bow,Hey! What's going on with you two?
4,6,5,Glimmer,Nothing!
4,6,5,Adora,Nothing!
4,6,5,Bow,"Okay, we're talking this out. Adora, is there something you need to say to Glimmer?"
4,6,5,Adora,"No! I don't know! What, it's fine!"
4,6,5,Bow,"Come on, you can do it! Communication is the key to a good friendship!"
4,6,5,Adora,I don't know why Glimmer is suddenly okay with trusting Shadow Weaver after everything she's done to us! I'm just--I'm worried about her...it's too dangerous.
4,6,5,Glimmer,You really think I'm naive enough to trust her?
4,6,5,Bow,Glimmer. Would you like to try phrasing that a little more constructively?
4,6,5,Glimmer,Everything I'm doing is to protect people...is to protect you. I'm not asking you to trust Shadow Weaver...but... can't you at least trust me?
4,6,5,Adora,"Of course I trust you, Glimmer."
4,6,5,Bow,There you go. That's how the Best Friend Squad does it!
4,6,5,Other,"Ugh, I have to do everything around here."
4,6,5,Other,"HELP! HELP! SHE-RA, HELP!"
4,6,5,Glimmer,Flutterina!
4,6,5,Other,HELP! HELP! Put me down! I'm on your side. Now follow my lead... HEEEELP!
4,6,6,Scorpia,Anything yet?
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Aah, I know we've looked everywhere, but it's gotta be here somewhere..."
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Super Pal Trio. Man, those were good times, huh? Focus! Scorpia, you can't let Catra down. ...Think like Entrapta... Think like Entrapta... Bots! Ehh, Hordak... Tiny food. Uh...First Ones tech... Runestones... The Black Garnet Chamber!"
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Yeah, this place also gives me the creeps. But, some of Entrapta's stuff is still in here, so the recordings might be, too. Wow. So many good times in here, huh? That time Entrapta hacked the Black Garnet...That time Shadow Weaver tried to kill us...And...before that... You're not going to believe this, Emily, but I'm actually a princess."
4,6,6,Scorpia,"I know, right? That's what they all say! It's ridiculous, I know, but...it's true. The whole Fright Zone used to be my family's kingdom, but then Hordak showed up and...well...you know. The rest is history. It's not like the Black Garnet ever worked for me anyway..."
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Ah, it's for the best. I mean, can you imagine? Me, a princess? I just need to find those recordings and then--"
4,6,6,Entrapta,"Commencing experiment number 703. Ready, Emily?"
4,6,6,Scorpia,Entrapta?
4,6,6,Entrapta,"Success! In addition to uploading back-ups of my logs into Emily's hard drive, I've upgraded her to record visual data. Hiiii! Now when an experiment blows up and I lose all memory of that day, I'll still have record of the research. Everyone, smile!"
4,6,6,Catra,I told you to be ready to leave. Have you even started packing?
4,6,6,Entrapta,I'm a scientist. The only thing I'll need in the Northern Reach is my miiind! ...Also my giant drill. ...Also...everything in this room.
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Super Pal Trio field trip! Ah, I can't wait! We can watch the snow fall, drink hot cocoa..."
4,6,6,Entrapta,"Oh, can the hot cocoa's be tiny?"
4,6,6,Catra,"We're there to dig up First Ones tech, we're not making cocoa."
4,6,6,Scorpia,"Oh, that's my Wildcat, always on goal. ...What do you think is buried out there, anyway?"
4,6,6,Entrapta,"Ohhh, something biiig!"
4,6,6,Catra,Who cares? Pack your stuff and let's go already.
4,6,6,Scorpia,I'll bring the cocoa if you bring the tiny mugs...?
4,6,6,Entrapta,"Oh, it's a date!"
4,6,6,Scorpia,Yeah!
4,6,6,Scorpia,"I...I miss her. Wait, Entrapta's recordings...she stored them inside you?! We did it, you beautiful bot, we found them! Oh, we've gotta go tell Catra that-- ...Well, can't you just take them out? Not possible?! They're deeply ingrained in your core processor and can't be accessed without dismantling you completely?!"
4,6,6,Scorpia,"But Catra needs these recordings, and I wanna be there for her! I'm loyal, that's my whole thing-- ...I'm sure it'll be fine. She wouldn't hurt you. She wouldn't...even though the recordings are...inside you and...she's kind of said the words ""scrap metal"" and ""Emily"" together a lot. ...Come on, I know a great place to hide--I-I mean, think, not hide. We're not hiding, we're...thinking. That's it."
4,6,7,Adora,"Bow, can you take them out?"
4,6,7,Bow,I can't risk hitting Flutterina!
4,6,7,Other,"Come on, work with me here!"
4,6,7,Other,Uh...drop your weapons...or the girl...gets it?
4,6,7,Other,"Ugh, it'll do."
4,6,7,Glimmer,"Let her go, now. Or it's not gonna be pretty."
4,6,7,Adora,"Glimmer, no. They could hurt Flutterina."
4,6,7,Glimmer,Someone has to do something.
4,6,7,Glimmer,Why isn't anyone guarding these outposts? Where is everyone?
4,6,7,Other,"Ah, I don't know!"
4,6,7,Glimmer,"I haven't practiced this one as much...I'm still getting the hang of it. It's a truth spell, if it works...but if it fails, it can be...extremely painful."
4,6,7,Other,"Okay, okay! Catra called back our bots and most of our team, but--I don't know why, I swear! I don't, I really don't!"
4,6,7,Glimmer,I think you do...
4,6,7,Bow,"Glimmer, stop!"
4,6,7,Glimmer,"Catra pulled her forces from the northern perimeter. We've been wasting our time all day. And this guy... is wasting mine. Bow, put him back with the others and let's go."
4,6,7,Adora,"Glimmer, what are you doing? You took things way too far."
4,6,7,Glimmer,I wasn't going to actually hurt him. Did you think I would really--
4,6,7,Bow,"Look, maybe we should get some rest and talk about this when--"
4,6,7,Adora,The Kingdom of Snows' supply line is open. We're done here.
4,6,7,Glimmer,Fine by me.
4,6,7,Other,And scene.
4,6,8,Scorpia,"Welcome to Horror Hall! It was part of the royal Scorpion Family's kingdom, but nobody comes here anymore. I would sneak down here to hide when I was a kid. Yeah... Oh! Check out these guys! That's Pointy, over there is Captain Pointy, and this here is the widow Madame Pointessa. Okay, I made those up, I don't know their names. But this!"
4,6,8,Scorpia,"This guy...this is my granddad, the King. He was the greatest. I mean, that's what the Horde told me anyway, I don't remember him, I was too young. I have granddad to thank for my opportunities in life. He made the alliance with Hordak. As part of it, our kingdom gave up our Runestone...and...princess... My granddad must've known I'd be...happier...as a soldier. And I made friends in the Horde...like you!"
4,6,8,Scorpia,"Ah. Okay, well... Things didn't exactly work out for my kingdom, but...granddad stayed loyal to the end. That's what scorpions do best! Brave, loyal...great hugs."
4,6,8,Scorpia,"I need to be there for Catra. I'll just tell her about the recordings. She is my friend, and she will not hurt you if I ask her not to."
4,6,8,Catra,I don't care what it takes. We are opening that portal! NOW!
4,6,8,Entrapta,"No! I won't! I need to tell Hordak, he'll understand!"
4,6,8,Catra,Get her out of here! I don't care--! Put her on the transport to Beast Island!
4,6,8,Scorpia,She--she was threatened. She didn't mean it...
4,6,8,Scorpia,Beast Island?! You can't!
4,6,8,Catra,You wanna be next?
4,6,8,Scorpia,Catra...betrayed her. ...She betrayed me. And I just let her take Entrapta away... Catra doesn't...care. She'll hurt people to get her way. If she knew the recordings were inside of you...
4,6,8,Scorpia,But I still have time. I can still be a good friend.
4,6,9,Catra,You better have something for me.
4,6,9,Scorpia,...Entrapta's recordings. She stored them all in Emily.
4,6,9,Scorpia,"The chip got damaged when I extracted it, but...hopefully that won't matter? It was just so small, and you know...pincers."
4,6,9,Catra,You broke...the recordings?
4,6,9,Scorpia,I-I didn't mean to--
4,6,9,Catra,"I asked you to do one thing! One simple thing and you completely ruined it! But of course you ruined it. Yeah. You're Scorpia. That's just what you do! You couldn't handle Emily...You never know when to shut up...The only thing you've ever done is get in my way! What did I expect, I mean, how could you possibly be this useless?!"
4,6,9,Catra,What?!
4,6,9,Scorpia,...You're a bad friend.
4,6,10,Hordak,The recordings?
4,6,10,Catra,Entrapta must've taken them with her before leaving. There's nothing.
4,6,10,Hordak,I gave you...an order...
4,6,10,Catra,"Get. Over. It. You don't need Entrapta. You never did. You don't need a princess in your life telling you what to do. Look at what you've done without her. You built an army. An empire. You and me...we don't need anyone. Forget them all, no one matters, nothing matters but this mission. You want to prove yourself? Prove your worth? Then do it. You and I are going to conquer Etheria, and then...and then, they'll all see!"
4,6,10,Hordak,"Oh, of course... Yes. We will prevail. Give me another day, and I will be ready."
4,6,10,Catra,Does that mean...I can give the command?
4,6,10,Hordak,It is time.
4,6,11,Scorpia,"Okay, I bought us some time. Catra didn't know that was just old junk or that I was...lying to her. ...There's nothing I can do for her...but maybe I can still help Entrapta."
4,6,11,Scorpia,"Ready for a Super Pal Duo field trip? We're getting out of here, Emily. For good."
4,7,0,Glimmer,I called you all here to discuss what happened today. The mission to retake Dryl was a complete disaster. We barely made it out. I wanna know why.
4,7,0,Bow,"The Horde knew we were coming, they were ready for us. How do they keep doing this? We thought they were tracking Adora, but she wasn't even there today!"
4,7,0,Mermista,Isn't it obvious? There's a Horde spy somewhere in Bright Moon. ...And no one is going anywhere until we figure out who it is.
4,7,0,Glimmer,Mermista... it's very unlikely that there's a spy--
4,7,0,Mermista,"We need to investigate. Obviously, I'll be the lead detective since I've read every single Mer-Mystery book."
4,7,0,Adora,Mer-what?
4,7,0,Mermista,"Mer-Mystery! It's only the best undersea novel series ever, there's, like, 18 of them, it taught me everything I need to know about solving mysteries. Murder mysteries!"
4,7,0,Perfuma,Um...but no one's been murdered...
4,7,0,Mermista,"YET! First, we need to question the suspects."
4,7,0,Frosta,Who are the suspects?
4,7,0,Mermista,Everyone is a suspect.
4,7,0,Bow,Everyone? Is anyone else sweating? I'm sweating!
4,7,0,Glimmer,This is a waste of time. We know that the Horde is pulling their troops back to prepare for something big. That's what we should be investigating.
4,7,0,Adora,"No, Mermista's right. And, we know it can't be me the Horde's tracking since, once again, you used me as a distraction today. ...A spy is really the only thing that makes sense."
4,7,0,Glimmer,"Maybe they didn't fall for the distraction because you're a bad actress. And who would the spy even be, anyway?"
4,7,0,Adora,"How about the Horde officer who's living at-- I'm sorry--being held prisoner, at Bright Moon? Shadow Weaver has actual shadow spies--we met them."
4,7,0,Mermista,"Shadow Weaver does seem like the obvious suspect. Which means it definitely isn't her. It's never the obvious one, like in Mer-Mystery: The Pearl Who Knew Too Much. You think it's the pearl, but it's not."
4,7,0,Perfuma,Spoilers!
4,7,0,Mermista,It's time to interrogate the castle!
4,7,0,Frosta,...How are you doing that?!
4,7,0,Mermista,I practice. At. HOME!
4,7,1,Catra,"Move, now! We don't have all night, Kyle!"
4,7,1,Double Trouble,"Meoow. You all right there, kitten?"
4,7,1,Catra,About time you checked in. Are the princesses still moping around about Dryl?
4,7,1,Double Trouble,"No. Watching them mope was my favorite. Now they're playing detective, searching for the elusive Horde spy who foiled their plans."
4,7,1,Catra,"Wait, spy? Is your cover blown?"
4,7,1,Double Trouble,"Please, who would suspect a goody-two-shoes like Flutterina? Besides, if they start to get suspicious, I'll just do a quick wardrobe change and throw the blame onto someone else."
4,7,1,Catra,"They better not. You have to keep them in Bright Moon. If they catch on before our plan is complete, before the big mission is done, I--"
4,7,1,Double Trouble,"Darling, darling, don't worry. I'll just tire them out a bit."
4,7,2,Mermista,Where were you when the murders happened?
4,7,2,Other,The what?
4,7,2,Perfuma,"...Don't think you can get away with it. ...Although, there still weren't any murders, Mermista."
4,7,2,Mermista,Yet!
4,7,2,Other,I sincerely do not have time for this.
4,7,2,Mermista,"Uh, according to a bunch of other people--"
4,7,2,Perfuma,Witnesses!
4,7,2,Mermista,--you weren't where you were supposed to be at the Battle for Dryl.
4,7,2,Other,I followed the plan exactly.
4,7,2,Perfuma,A likely--! Sorry... A likely story!
4,7,2,Mermista,"Admit it. You were slipping away to warn the Horde of our plan. Just like in Mer-Mystery: Secret of the Abalone. That one's really good, you should read it."
4,7,2,Other,"Look, this is what happened."
4,7,2,Other,"On approach to Dryl, Glimmer filled me in. She-Ra would lure away the Horde. Team A--Frosta, Bow, and Flutterina--would scout ahead. Team B--Sea Hawk and Mermista--would guard the exits. Team A indicated the coast was clear and we converged on their signal. But that's when Frosta ran into us and said they hadn't finished scouting!"
4,7,2,Perfuma,"Oh, my!"
4,7,2,Other,"Team A sent the all-clear. If you want to know what went wrong, ask Bow."
4,7,3,Bow,"Okay, I confess, it was me!"
4,7,3,Frosta,"Bow, we're not even interrogating you."
4,7,3,Bow,"I mean, if I am the spy, it's an accident...I think... Can you be an accidental spy? Do I have an evil alter-ego? Or was I secretly brainwashed and I'm just realizing it now?!"
4,7,3,Other,"So, like, are you guys still questioning me, or...?"
4,7,3,Bow,It all goes back to what happened in Dryl...
4,7,3,Bow,"Everyone was in position, and I was using my new tech to look for remaining Horde soldiers. But then my goggles glitched and--I don't know what happened! I started to see double. That's when the other team came in way too early! I tried to signal everyone to fall back, but my tracker pad was missing."
4,7,3,Other,Whoaaa...
4,7,3,Bow,"Don't you see what this means? Either I lost my tracker pad at Dryl, and that gave the Horde vital information...or...I did it on purpose because I am the spy and I gave the signal and I didn't even know!"
4,7,3,Other,You're blowing my miiiind...!
4,7,3,Frosta,BOW! You aren't. The spy!
4,7,3,Bow,You don't know that! It all makes sense... Who else could it be?!
4,7,4,Adora,So you're telling us you really didn't know anything about the plan to retake Dryl? Really?
4,7,4,Shadow Weaver,"Not a bit. I've been busy with my garden. She's always been paranoid like this, you know."
4,7,4,Adora,"I am not being paranoid. You were spotted around the castle without your guards this morning, and I wanna know why..."
4,7,4,Glimmer,"Actually, Adora, that's--"
4,7,4,Shadow Weaver,I was engaging in a ritual.
4,7,4,Shadow Weaver,"Essence of echinacea. A dash of ginger root. Ah, my daily morning ritual."
4,7,4,Adora,"Okay, you expect us to believe you were just having tea?! She's the spy, you're the spy! Who else could it be?"
4,7,4,Shadow Weaver,"I am not the villain of this story. As to your question, Glimmer saw fit to grant me free reign of the castle. My guards have been dismissed."
4,7,4,Adora,No guards? Seriously?!
4,7,4,Glimmer,"Yes, seriously! What has she done other than help us?"
4,7,4,Adora,Do you really want me to answer that?
4,7,4,Shadow Weaver,"Girls, every moment you waste here, the Horde gets that much further ahead. In order to catch a rat, you need to spring a trap."
4,7,4,Adora,"Well, in order to catch the spy...we need you to admit that you're the spy--!"
4,7,4,Glimmer,"Let it go, Adora! There's lots of other people it could be."
4,7,4,Adora,Like who?
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,"Ah, I love recounting the epic tales of my exploits. My HEROIC exploits."
4,7,5,Mermista,"Yeah, it definitely isn't Sea Hawk. Why did you even bring him in?"
4,7,5,Perfuma,You said everyone was a suspect.
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,Exploits for the ages! Narration!
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,"I was supposed to be guarding the door, but Perfuma relieved me of duty so I could rejoin the fight. I advanced through the courtyard, avoiding the booby traps risking my very...life... Just like in Mer-Mystery: Serpent of the Sea!"
4,7,5,Mermista,"Wait, is that where my book went? Sea Hawk, I've been looking for it!"
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,That's when the clouds parted--
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,--and illuminated my dearest Mermista in the distance.
4,7,5,Mermista,Moonlight? The battle happened this morning.
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,"I made my way over to her, when----we were ambushed! My sole aim was to protect Mermista from the Horde... Thinking quick, I took on the 40 to 50 Horde soldiers surrounding us and SAVED DRYL!"
4,7,5,Mermista,"We lost Dryl, and you punched, like, one guy before Glimmer got us out."
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,Exactly! One HUNDRED guys!
4,7,5,Perfuma,"W-Wait, wait--I-I was with the General the whole time! And why weren't you with Sea Hawk, Mermista?"
4,7,5,Mermista,"Uh, because Frosta waved me over, but, like, disappeared before I could reach her."
4,7,5,Perfuma,"But that doesn't make any sense, she was with Bow, and then...Glimmer and the others were--"
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,Who wants to watch me do some squats?
4,7,5,Sea Hawk,I bet Adora and Glimmer don't shove suspects out the door...
4,7,6,Glimmer,"...Okay, Flutterina. Where were you at the start of the battle?"
4,7,6,Other,"With Bow and Frosta, of course. Like we planned. ...Is...Is everything okay?"
4,7,6,Glimmer,Everything is fine. Now--
4,7,6,Other,"It's just that, everyone's so on edge after what happened in Dryl. Have you tried interviewing Shadow Weaver about it? She seems kinda untrustworthy..."
4,7,6,Adora,"Oh, noo, according to Glimmer, she's totally trustworthy, and it's fine to just let her walk around the castle whenever she wants..."
4,7,6,Glimmer,Can we please not start this up again?
4,7,6,Adora,"I'm just saying, it would have been nice if you told me."
4,7,6,Glimmer,I don't have to tell you about every decision I make.
4,7,6,Adora,"Oh, but you tell Shadow Weaver?!"
4,7,6,Glimmer,Maybe it's because Shadow Weaver actually listened when you and Bow kept leaving without me!
4,7,6,Other,You two seem like you have a lot to talk about... Maybe I'll just come back later...
4,7,6,Glimmer,"I don't know why I'm going along with this. The Horde is obviously planning something. We should be out there, looking for them, not stuck here, playing around."
4,7,6,Adora,"No one's playing around, Glimmer. There is a reason we've been losing."
4,7,6,Glimmer,And we're going to keep losing if we don't act soon.
4,7,6,Mermista,"There you are. Why are you just standing around? This isn't Mer-Mystery: Case of the People Who Just Stood Around, the...sequel I wrote right now about all of you."
4,7,6,Glimmer,Who is even left to question?
4,7,8,Other,I think I saw Mermista with Bow's tracker pad.
4,7,8,Bow,"Wait, have you guys been here the entire time?"
4,7,8,Other,...Tiny scone?
4,7,8,Other,"I can't believe you read those, too! Mer-Mystery: The Maltese Otter is my favorite."
4,7,8,Mermista,"Ugh, that one's so predictable. I saw that twist coming a mile away."
4,7,8,Adora,Swift Wind! You weren't even there!
4,7,8,Sea Hawk,"I told you how I took out one hundred--no--one hundred and fifty guys, right?"
4,7,8,Bow,"You have to arrest me, for everyone's safety! Otherwise my evil alter-ego might do it again!"
4,7,8,Glimmer,"Bow, knock it off."
4,7,8,Adora,Still no! ...And put that back.
4,7,8,Mermista,It's not them.
4,7,8,Perfuma,No.
4,7,8,Glimmer,No.
4,7,8,Other,"I think, like, maybe She-Ra did it."
4,7,8,Frosta,Hey! We already questioned you.
4,7,8,Other,"Oh, yeah. I came back for the tiny scones."
4,7,8,Other,I made a fresh batch!
4,7,8,Other,Fizzy beverage?
4,7,8,Perfuma,"If you just lent me the book, then I'd show you who done it! I think we should interrogate him again! I don't trust--"
4,7,8,Mermista,--happened in Pearl In The Window.)
4,7,9,Adora,Glimmer? Where are you going?
4,7,9,Glimmer,This isn't working. Nothing we do is working. The Horde is always ahead and I can't just sit here and wait for the next bad thing to happen.
4,7,9,Adora,"So, what? You're gonna teleport into the Fright Zone and try to solve this all by yourself?"
4,7,9,Glimmer,Someone's gotta do something.
4,7,9,Adora,"Glimmer, please. You can't leave in the middle of the night without backup."
4,7,9,Glimmer,"The less people involved, the better. We don't know who to trust."
4,7,9,Adora,And what about me? Were you gonna tell me? Or Bow?
4,7,9,Glimmer,"Adora, I--"
4,7,9,Adora,"Stay. Please. I know we can figure this out if we work together. No more secrets, and doing things without us. We need you here. ...I need you here."
4,7,9,Glimmer,Okay. I'm here.
4,7,9,Bow,Adora! Glimmer!
4,7,9,Frosta,Where have you guys been?!
4,7,9,Perfuma,The communications panel in the war room has been severed!
4,7,10,Adora,When did this happen?
4,7,10,Mermista,I don't know. We were passing by the room when we saw it.
4,7,10,Frosta,Wait. We saw you run out of here two minutes ago.
4,7,10,Mermista,"Uh, what are you talking about? I was with Perfuma."
4,7,10,Perfuma,Could the storm have done something to cause this?
4,7,10,Glimmer,This wasn't an accident. This was sabotage.
4,7,11,Glimmer,"...The General is working on restoring communications. In the meantime, there's a backup device in the dining room, should we need it."
4,7,11,Mermista,All of us here knew we were trying to unmask the spy. And we were the ones who made the plan to take back Dryl. We've ruled out all other suspects. Which means the only person the spy could be is one. Of. Us.
4,7,11,Frosta,Perfuma was the one who let the Horde take the doors!
4,7,11,Perfuma,"I wasn't there! Wait, your team was the one who told us to come in, and you led Mermista away!"
4,7,11,Frosta,I. Did. Not.
4,7,11,Mermista,"Trying to throw the blame on someone else, huh, Frosta?"
4,7,11,Frosta,"If Mermista knows so much about mysteries, she'd probably know how to plan the perfect crime."
4,7,11,Perfuma,And there was water by the tracker pad!
4,7,11,Mermista,Water that could've been melted ice!
4,7,11,Bow,It's probably me!
4,7,11,Frosta,"It's not you, Bow!"
4,7,11,Mermista,"Or maybe it is, like in Mer-Mystery: Salt-er Ego!"
4,7,11,Sea Hawk,"It couldn't be me, I was busy fighting at least 200 soldiers!"
4,7,11,Adora,"This is a waste of time, Glimmer. Shouldn't we be--?"
4,7,11,Glimmer,"Stop. Stop questioning my choices, stop whining about being a decoy, just--stop. Okay?"
4,7,11,Adora,I'm not whining!
4,7,11,Glimmer,All you do is question me. Question my authority. It's exhausting.
4,7,11,Sea Hawk,"Okay, I lied. I didn't fight 300 soldiers. Mermista, will you ever forgive me?"
4,7,11,Mermista,"Sea Hawk, we all knew that."
4,7,11,Bow,I don't know who to believe anymore...I can't trust my own eyes! Who am I?!
4,7,11,Adora,Look at what she's doing. Look at what she's doing to you. Shadow Weaver just wants power and you are listening to her.
4,7,11,Glimmer,"Oh, what? Are you jealous because you aren't Shadow Weaver's favorite anymore? Or are you just mad that I'm Queen and in charge and you're not?"
4,7,11,Adora,That's. Ridiculous!
4,7,11,Glimmer,You just run around playing the perfect hero. You have no idea how hard it's been for me.
4,7,11,Adora,Because you stopped including me in your decisions! We used to be a team. And now? I don't know what we are.
4,7,12,Other,"Come on, backup communicator, where are youuu?"
4,7,12,Glimmer,"Hey, Flutterina. Looking for something?"
4,7,12,Other,"Glimmer? Adora. Hi...Hi. Uh, just looking for the bathroom."
4,7,12,Other,"Okay...Okay, this looks bad, but I assure you, it isn't what it looks like, so let's all just--"
4,7,12,Other,Ohoho. I see...
4,7,12,Glimmer,"Give it up, Flutterina. If that's really who you are."
4,7,12,Other,Magic. How very clever.
4,7,12,Adora,Isn't it? Shadow Weaver helped.
4,7,12,Glimmer,You see--
4,7,12,Mermista,The reveal of how they caught the murderer is my favorite part!
4,7,12,Adora,"In order to catch a rat, you need to spring a trap. So we set one up of our own."
4,7,12,Mermista,Classic murder mystery move.
4,7,12,Perfuma,There's no murder--never mind.
4,7,12,Glimmer,We knew a backup communication device would be irresistible to whoever destroyed the original.
4,7,12,Adora,"We wanted the spy to feel safe enough to make a move, so we created a diversion."
4,7,12,Glimmer,Adora managed to be a really good actress...for once.
4,7,12,Adora,"It was really hard, do not ask me to do that again."
4,7,12,Glimmer,So that brings us back to you. Who are you really...Flutterina?
4,7,12,Double Trouble,Call me Double Trouble.
4,7,12,Adora,You're a shapeshifter...
4,7,12,Bow,"It wasn't my goggles glitching. It was you, pretending to be Frosta at Dryl."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"And Perfuma. Don't short change my credits, darling."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"May I say, as one actor to another, that was truly a masterful performance. I really bought that you two were furious at each other. If you would indulge me, were you inspired by any real emotion or experience?"
4,7,12,Glimmer,"Enough. It's over, Double Trouble. Now tell us what the Horde is planning..."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"Over? Ohohoho, love, it's just beginning. The Horde has been planning a massive attack for some time now."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"I let Catra know you were going to Dryl. After that, all I had to do was plant seeds of doubt. Sowing chaos where I could. It wasn't hard. I just had to keep you isolated and at each other's throats until..."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"...the plan was underway. ...Salineas. If the Horde controls the seas, they control Etheria."
4,7,12,Glimmer,"That will never happen. We won't let it. Now that we know their plan, we can stop it."
4,7,12,Double Trouble,"Oh, stop it? Oh, this was a ruse, darling. A distraction. The Battle of Salineas is over. It happened earlier this very evening. It's too late. Salineas is gone."
4,7,12,Mermista,No...
4,7,12,Glimmer,"No. No, i-i-it's not too late! It can't be!"
4,7,13,Adora,...We can fix this. We have to be able to fix this...right?
4,7,13,Glimmer,"This won't. Happen. Again. I won't let it. We won't give up. We will take back Salineas, take back all of Etheria..."
4,7,13,Glimmer,No matter what it costs. No matter what the Horde throws at us next.
4,8,0,Hordak,Advance.
4,8,0,Sea Hawk,"Fear not, tiny friends... For Sea Hawk is here!"
4,8,0,Sea Hawk,"Well, perhaps we should fear a little. Let's go!"
4,8,0,Glimmer,Hang on!
4,8,0,Sea Hawk,Huh?
4,8,1,Glimmer,"Netossa, this is the last of them, sound the--wait. Where's Sea Hawk?"
4,8,1,Sea Hawk,...Adventure?
4,8,1,Glimmer,Okay. Now sound the retreat.
4,8,1,Glimmer,I'll be back for you.
4,8,2,Bow,"I know it's been tough going since losing Salineas, but we're picking up the pieces. I'm sure we can turn this around. I mean, we captured Double Trouble. They're...refusing to talk to us, but still. So, uh... Swift Wind! You just got back from scouting the Southern Coast. What does it look like?"
4,8,2,Swift Wind,On fire.
4,8,2,Bow,Anything more specific?
4,8,2,Swift Wind,On lots of fire.
4,8,2,Bow,Okayyy... Adora! You came from Plumeria; what's their status? Any good news?
4,8,2,Adora,Perfuma is securing the Whispering Woods and Frosta reports that her kingdom has not been breached...
4,8,2,Bow,Great.
4,8,2,Adora,...yet. But the Horde's working on it. Day and night. Nonstop.
4,8,2,Bow,"Well...that is...ooo-kayyy. Because Sea Hawk, Netossa, and Spinnerella just saved everyone in Sea Elf Village...with Glimmer. Who didn't tell us she was going, but just...kind of showed up."
4,8,2,Adora,"Again? Glimmer, you can't just keep going off on your own."
4,8,2,Glimmer,"Hmm, where have I heard that before? Oh, right. When I stayed here to find the Horde spy and Salineas fell."
4,8,2,Adora,That's not fair. We didn't know.
4,8,2,Glimmer,Tell that to Mermista.
4,8,2,Swift Wind,"Hey, where is Mermista?"
4,8,3,Mermista,"Oh, look. More ice cream. Cause I'm the princess of ice cream now."
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,"She's, um, taking some ""me time""."
4,8,4,Bow,"""Me time""! Great... We all could use some of that. So let's check in with each other more often, and Glimmer if you could--"
4,8,4,Glimmer,I'm not going to hide inside the castle while our people are in danger. I'm the Queen. You don't give me orders.
4,8,4,Bow,"O...kay, I get that you're upset, but--"
4,8,4,Adora,Don't talk to Bow like that.
4,8,4,Bow,"Adora, it's fine, Glimmer's just--"
4,8,4,Glimmer,I need to stop the Horde. Any way I can. ...We're done for today.
4,8,4,Adora,"Ugh, fine. Clearly, we aren't going to get anything done right now."
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,"All in all, not the worst meeting we've had."
4,8,4,Bow,I've never seen Glimmer like this. Or Adora. I just wish I knew how to help them.
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,"Ah, don't blame yourself, lad. ...Hey, you know, I just had an idea, not pre-planned at all. Let's take a break and have a boys' night out on the town!"
4,8,4,Swift Wind,"Can I come, too?"
4,8,4,Bow,I should really stay here in case Glimmer and Adora need me...
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,One night off won't hurt. What do you say?
4,8,4,Swift Wind,"Boys' night out, boys' night out, boys' night out, BOYS' NIGHT OUT! ...Why am I the only one doing this?"
4,8,4,Bow,You know what? Why not?
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,Grand! And then my brilliant secret plan can begin...
4,8,4,Bow,What's that?
4,8,4,Sea Hawk,Nothingggg! Forward to a friendship adventure!
4,8,5,Catra,Lord Hordak. Sounds like congratulations are in order.
4,8,5,Hordak,"Yes... The princesses are in utter disarray...abandoning territory, scattering like cowards before us like the cowards they are."
4,8,5,Catra,"We're crushing them. Once you return to the Fright Zone, I'll march our troops on the rest of the coastal towns."
4,8,5,Hordak,"No. Now that Horde Prime's arrival is imminent, I shall remain in the field to ensure victory. ...Besides. Out of all the princesses, Entrapta has yet to face me on the field..."
4,8,5,Catra,And what exactly am I supposed to do while you remain in the field?
4,8,5,Hordak,Whatever I deem necessary to win. Return to your post in the Fright Zone and await my orders. ...Soon all of Etheria will be at my feet.
4,8,5,Catra,"Force Captain Octavia, have you finished your perimeter?"
4,8,5,Other,We're doing the final sweep.
4,8,5,Catra,"Excellent. Double Trouble should be breaking radio silence soon...they'll have new coordinates for you. Force Captain Scorpia, come in."
4,8,5,Catra,"Aw, man. Even when he's winning, Hordak is annoying. Now he suddenly loves fighting, and I'm getting stuck with whatever he ""deems necessary"". Never thought I'd miss shut-in Hordak. Meet me at the Sea Gate, I wanna take a break anyway."
4,8,6,Bow,"Sea Hawk, I thought you said boys' night out, it's the middle of day."
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"New experiences! Huzzah! Day, night, it matters not. You're overdue for some levity."
4,8,6,Bow,"Last time I was here it was with Adora and Glimmer, and...things were great... Not like now."
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,It is true. Things are looking...dour...
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,This drink is...extra sour...
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,Could be the Rebellion's......darkest...hour... Nonsense! You know why? Hit it!
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"Oh, when the seas are rough and dire / we turn to friends and we conspire / to relight the sacred fire / of rebellion! When the Horde tightens their noose / around our daring sea rescues / we take some time to cut loose / from the rebellion! Sure friends aren't seeing eye to eye! / Tis no reason to curl up and die! Friendship just needs a resupply!"
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends!"
4,8,6,Swift Wind,"Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun, it's fun to be friends with friends!"
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"And when Hordak hits us robotical / we'll respond with tunes most...nautical / and take a moment to...to... to, to, to, to t-uh, to pop! soda botticals!"
4,8,6,Swift Wind,"Oh, man. Third rhyme. Rough stuff."
4,8,6,Swift Wind,"Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends! / Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends!"
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends! / Oh how fun, how fun to be friends with friends!"
4,8,6,Bow,"Sometimes we'll fight but that's okay, we'll work it out another day / I know things will work out in the end!"
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"Oh, yes!"
4,8,6,Bow,Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Swift Wind,Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! / Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Bow,Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Swift Wind,Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,Oh it's fun to be friends with friends!
4,8,6,Bow,It's an ambush!
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"Whoo, better! It's a kidnapping!"
4,8,6,Bow,"Sea Hawk, what are you doing?!"
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,Don't worry. It's all a part of my brilliant secret plan.
4,8,6,Swift Wind,What plan?
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"To unite the princesses and cheer up my dearest Mermista. They love rescuing people... so I paid my friend Bill to kidnap us! The ladies will put aside their problems to rescue us, go on a mission of fun, and then it's a happy ending for all!"
4,8,6,Bow,Wait. You paid them to--
4,8,6,Sea Hawk,"The princesses will stop their fight / When they save us, it'll be all right / We'll hang with Bill the rest / of the night / it's fun to be friends with friends...sha-boom-bity-boom-bam-boo... / Hey, Bill, did you get...taller? and when did you get that...scar? You, uh, you didn't...have a scar... This might not be Bill. ...No, this isn't Bill."
4,8,6,Bow,What?!
4,8,7,Swift Wind,What do we do?
4,8,7,Bow,"We have to get a message to our friends. Swift Wind, try to contact Adora through your sacred bond."
4,8,7,Sea Hawk,"Yeah, yeah, yes-yes. My plan can still work. They'll just unite to rescue us for real this time. Nothing's spun out of control... Do your thing, noble steed."
4,8,7,Swift Wind,"Come on, Adora, pick up. Pick up..."
4,8,8,Glimmer,Mermista? Are you alone?
4,8,8,Mermista,Totally...
4,8,8,Glimmer,I thought you said you were alone?
4,8,8,Mermista,I am... Deep down inside...so...alone... Are you two gonna fight again? Whatever...
4,8,8,Glimmer,"I was just...checking up on Mermista, but, clearly, you have it covered."
4,8,8,Adora,"Glimmer, what is going on with you? I know things are bad right now, but...we can fix it--"
4,8,8,Glimmer,Why is that always your answer to everything?!
4,8,8,Adora,Because it's the only thing we can do.
4,8,8,Glimmer,"Things are worse than ever. The Horde has Salineas, the coast is falling, we haven't FIXED anything!"
4,8,8,Adora,"That's why we need to work together instead of you pushing us away, and if you'd just listened to us, you'd know that, and why can I hear the ocean right now?!"
4,8,9,Bow,Anything?
4,8,9,Swift Wind,"Ah! She hung up on me. But I could tell that she's in distress... I-I should be at her side, right now!"
4,8,9,Bow,"Swift Wind, calm. Down. It'll be okay. We'll figure something out."
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,Fear not. I know how to get a message to my sweet Mermista. After all...she taught me how to speak seagullllll! ...I may be a bit rusty.
4,8,9,Other,What's all this yammering about?
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,"Admiral--! Admiral Scurvy, my old friend... It's just like you to, uh, take over someone else's jovial prank... Isn't it fun being friends? Oooohhh--!"
4,8,9,Other,"Absolutely not! Friends? Heh. We were friends. But I've had to rebuild my last three ships because you set them on fire. Honestly, who does that?!"
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,"Come on, now, Scurvy...isn't this all just a bit extreme?"
4,8,9,Bow,Admiral Scurvy! ...Sir! Whatever Sea Hawk has done in the past...can't you put that aside for the sake of your friendship?
4,8,9,Other,"Friendship? Whoo, boy... Listen up, kid. Friendship is overrated. There's only one thing in this world that matters...money. And lucky for you, the three of you have some value to me yet."
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,This was all a terrible idea. Why didn't anyone stop me?
4,8,9,Swift Wind,Because you didn't tell us. Why didn't you tell us?!
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,"If I told you, you would have stopped me."
4,8,9,Bow,...It's okay! 'Cause it's fun to be friends with friends! Remember?
4,8,9,Sea Hawk,This is no time for songs.
4,8,9,Swift Wind,"Yeah, read the room, Bow."
4,8,9,Bow,"Look, as soon as they realize we're gone, Adora and Glimmer will stop fighting and come for us. I know they will."
4,8,10,Catra,"Hey, Scorpia. Where are you? It's not like you to be late. ...Listen, I'll kill you if you tell anyone this, but... I thought winning would be...different. Or at least, more... I don't know... Fun?"
4,8,10,Catra,"Come on. You're not still mad about before... Are ya? Stop being so sensitive. Get over it and talk to me, Scorpia."
4,8,10,Catra,...Scorpia? ...Scorpia?!
4,8,11,Other,"Good news, boys. Someone cared enough about you three, to pay a hefty ransom!"
4,8,11,Sea Hawk,The princesses...of course! Just like I planned.
4,8,11,Other,"All that very loud, very public singing about the Rebellion, and you think your ransom was paid by the princesses?"
4,8,11,Other,The Horde controls the seas now. And they're paying top dollar for high-ranking Rebel prisoners.
4,8,11,Other,As promised.
4,8,11,Sea Hawk,Scurvy...don't do this.You and I lived by a sacred code...the law of the sea. We are like brothers... If our friendship ever meant anything to you--
4,8,11,Other,It didn't.
4,8,11,Other,"Your friends aren't coming, kid. I don't think they've even noticed you're gone. Oh, friends..."
4,8,12,Glimmer,Just because you're She-Ra doesn't mean you can order people around!
4,8,12,Adora,You just keep pushing us away!
4,8,12,Glimmer,"I am Queen of Etheria, okay? Not--"
4,8,12,Adora,--and going rogue and leaving! What are we supposed to do with that? We're trying our best!]
4,8,12,Glimmer,"You think you can just transform into She-Ra, and hit things with your sword, and it will fix everything! Well, guess what: It's not working!"
4,8,12,Adora,Why are you blaming this all on me? It's not my fault that Salineas fell! The Horde manipulated all of us!
4,8,12,Glimmer,She-Ra was supposed to save us. But the Rebellion's in a worse place than ever since you showed up!
4,8,12,Adora,I'm trying my best. Why can't you see that?
4,8,12,Glimmer,"Well, maybe your best isn't good enough. If it was, my mother would still be here!"
4,8,12,Glimmer,Adora--Adora I'm I'm sorry...
4,8,12,Mermista,"The boys are in trouble! A seagull told me! I may have lost my kingdom, but I'm not losing anyone else. Sea-Ra is back in action! Let's go!"
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,So...what happened to the eye?
4,8,13,Other,"Oh, this? Catra scratched it out when she was six. And now... I bet she's gonna do the exact same thing to all of you!"
4,8,13,Bow,I don't care.
4,8,13,Other,Hey! I'm threatening you.
4,8,13,Bow,I don't care! You know what? It's not easy being the friendly and upbeat guy all the time. And I get that it's hard being friends sometimes. You gotta work at it. ...So why am I always the only one who's willing to work at it? I mean...they didn't even notice I'm gone. ...Do whatever you want. I don't care. It's terrible being friends with friends.
4,8,13,Other,"Oh, yeesh. Ready at the rendezvous point. You guys gotta get this kid off my ship, he's bringing me down. ...Scorpia? ...Scorpia, come in."
4,8,13,Other,"Force Captain Octavia, we got magic incoming!"
4,8,13,Other,What?!
4,8,13,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
4,8,13,Glimmer,Look out!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Mermista! You're back in the game!
4,8,13,Mermista,Never felt better. Rescuing people is my jam.
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,"I knew it! Never doubted my brilliant plan for a moment. Oh, how fun--"
4,8,13,Mermista,No shanties! Hit it.
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,I thought you said no shanties?
4,8,13,Mermista,"This isn't a shanty, it's like a rock remix, so...it's cool."
4,8,13,Mermista,You can't keep me down / Can't throw this princess around / 'Cause you know how this all ends
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,With punches and kicks / And magical tricks / On each other we all depend
4,8,13,Mermista,I'll blast you away / And fight another day / For Salineas!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,"Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!"
4,8,13,Mermista,"Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!"
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Mermista,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,It's hard to fight with friends!
4,8,13,Mermista,It's hard to fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,"Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!"
4,8,13,Mermista,"Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!"
4,8,13,Bow,"Yeah, it's fun to fight hard with friends!"
4,8,13,Bow,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Mermista,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Bow,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,Fight with friends!
4,8,13,Mermista,It's hard to fight with friends!
4,8,13,Sea Hawk,It's hard to fight with friends!
4,8,13,Bow,It's hard to fight with friends!
4,8,14,Catra,Scorpia? ...Scorpia?
4,8,15,Sea Hawk,And that is the tale of how I united everyone with my brilliant plan!
4,8,15,Mermista,"Whatever, you goober. Your plan was terrible. But I'm done moping in a bathtub. I'm ready to fight, to destroy the Horde and get my kingdom back!"
4,8,15,Sea Hawk,That's my girl!
4,8,15,Mermista,"Also, Bright Moon ran out of ice cream."
4,8,15,Sea Hawk,That's also my girl!
4,8,15,Sea Hawk,Sea Hawk--
4,8,15,Mermista,We should always fight to music. It's awesome.]
4,8,15,Bow,"Adora, you and Glimmer--"
4,8,15,Adora,"I know what I have to do, Bow. I'm going to look for Mara's weapon. The one she mentioned in the message. Maybe it can turn the tide of the war for us. ...It has to."
4,8,15,Bow,"What are you talking about? Glimmer doesn't need a weapon, she needs her friends."
4,8,15,Adora,"No, she doesn't. But it doesn't matter. I will fix this...no matter what Glimmer thinks of me."
4,8,15,Sea Hawk,"The Best Friends Squad on the sea / we subdued the threat / the threat with ease / we sail the world / come near or far / we're best friends we are, we are / we're best friends, we are, we are!"
4,8,15,Bow,"We're best friends, we are...we are..."
4,9,0,Razz,Broom! Where are you? Broom?! ...Ah! There you are. What are you just sitting around for? Today is an important day. We have to get ready for our guest!
4,9,0,Razz,Perfect.
4,9,0,Razz,"Oh, Adora! You're just in time."
4,9,0,Mara,"Razz, I told you before, my name isn't Adora. It's Mara."
4,9,1,Razz,"Yes, yes, of course you're Mara. Who else would you be? Now, come on, silly! We don't have much time. Today is a very important day!"
4,9,1,Mara,"Why is today important, Razz?"
4,9,1,Razz,"Eh, because... Because, eh... it's important... Because today----we are making a pie! Don't you remember? You promised!"
4,9,1,Mara,"That sounds great, Razz. But I can't stay long today."
4,9,1,Razz,"Ah, nonsense, dearie... Now, will you help Madame Razz find her rolling pin? It must be around here somewhere..."
4,9,2,Razz,It's a rolling--
4,9,2,Adora,Madame Razz?
4,9,2,Razz,...Mara?
4,9,2,Adora,"Oh, Razz! It's you! I finally found you."
4,9,2,Razz,"Mm, if you say so, Mara. Now, come on, it's getting so late!"
4,9,2,Adora,"I'm not Mara...! Ugh, it doesn't matter. Razz, you have to help me. Everything's falling apart. The Rebellion is losing worse than ever, and Glimmer----I need to find another way to help the Rebellion. I know we can still win this. There was something Mara said in her message--she talked about...some kind of weapon. ...You do know something. If there's some kind of First Ones weapon out there, you need to tell me! We could use it to defeat the Horde, and free Etheria, and then Glimmer would finally see that she was wrong about-- ...What was that for?"
4,9,2,Razz,"Agh! You need to stop being so forgetful, Mara. We're making pie today with Swift Wind."
4,9,2,Adora,"Once again, I am Adora, and Swift Wind isn't even--"
4,9,2,Swift Wind,Hello!
4,9,2,Adora,"Swift Wind, what are you even doing here?"
4,9,2,Swift Wind,"Oh, I visit Razz all the time. You gotta check up on old ladies alone in the woods. Come on, Adora, have a heart."
4,9,2,Adora,"Okay, maybe you can help. I need Razz to tell me about Mara's weapon."
4,9,2,Swift Wind,"Mara's weapon? Like...the sword? She-Ra's sword? Oo, did I solve it?! Did I solve the mystery?!"
4,9,2,Adora,"No! The weapon Mara talked about in her last message on the ship. Bow's with the ship trying to clean it up, but... it's still too glitchy to make out. Razz..."
4,9,2,Razz,--Those!
4,9,2,Adora,You knew Mara. Did she ever tell you-- What are you looking for?!
4,9,2,Razz,"Sugar for the pie! I must have some around here somewhere. Never mind... I know where we can get more! Come, dearie, not a moment to waste, let's go!"
4,9,2,Adora,Apparently we're making pie.
4,9,3,Razz,"--Oh, yes...--"
4,9,3,Adora,Wait!
4,9,3,Swift Wind,"Why are we following a wacky old lady through the woods, again?"
4,9,3,Adora,Because she knows something about the weapon! Razz is leading us somewhere important. Somewhere where I can get answers. I'm sure of it.
4,9,3,Swift Wind,"Adora, as your noble steed, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Razz is kind of--"
4,9,3,Razz,"Ha! Have to get up earlier than that to trick me, Loo-Kee!"
4,9,3,Swift Wind,"Well, you know, she's, uh--she's Razz. Do you really think she knows anything?"
4,9,3,Adora,"Madame Razz always shows up exactly when I need her most. She helped save you, and she helped stop the portal... She knows more than she lets on. There is a method to this... I just have to figure it out."
4,9,3,Swift Wind,Is losing her part of the method?
4,9,3,Adora,...Razz? ...Razz?
4,9,3,Adora,Razz!
4,9,3,Razz,"Adora, come! There's not much time. You need to keep up--"
4,9,4,Razz,--where are you?
4,9,4,Mara,Who are you? How did you find this place?
4,9,4,Razz,"Ah, Mara, dearie, there you are. Madame Razz wondered where you went."
4,9,4,Mara,H--? How do you know my name?
4,9,4,Razz,"Oh, is this the first time? It's been so long since the first time. Never mind! Razz is only here to borrow some sugar."
4,9,4,Mara,"Wha-- Hey! This location is highly classified, you can't just--"
4,9,4,Razz,"How can you find anything in here, Adora? This place is a mess!"
4,9,4,Mara,Give it--!
4,9,4,Mara,...Magic. You know how to use magic. H-hey! Stop that!
4,9,4,Razz,Wowww....
4,9,4,Mara,"No, don't--!"
4,9,4,Razz,"Mine...it's...mine, I--"
4,9,4,Light Hope,Intruder detected.
4,9,4,Razz,Razzle Dazzle!
4,9,4,Light Hope,"Mara, who is this person?"
4,9,4,Mara,I don't know. She just...wandered in.
4,9,4,Razz,"Do you see the ghost, too?"
4,9,4,Light Hope,Her presence is unauthorized. You must remove her from the premises or I will be forced to alert your superiors.
4,9,4,Razz,Your ghost is mean.
4,9,4,Mara,What are you looking for?
4,9,4,Razz,"Sugar! How can Madame Razz make a pie without sugar? Agh... Don't ask such silly questions, Adora."
4,9,4,Mara,...Adora?
4,9,4,Razz,I need to get up. Why do I put it so high?
4,9,4,Mara,"Razz, is it? All right, here you go. Sugar."
4,9,4,Razz,"Ah! Thank you, dearie."
4,9,4,Light Hope,You cannot let her take things and leave. She could've been exposed to classified data about the Heart of Etheria Project. We need to detain and interrogate her.
4,9,4,Mara,"You really think she's somehow found information about a project so classified even I don't know all the details? Come on, Hope, look at her. She's clearly harmless. Besides, we're here to study this planet's magic, aren't we? Who'd know more about Etheria's magic than the Etherians?"
4,9,4,Light Hope,You know I have to report this. It is in my programming.
4,9,4,Mara,"Can't you let it slide? Please, Hope? For me?"
4,9,4,Light Hope,...Unauthorized...presence...not...detected. Any reports to the contrary... are incorrect.
4,9,4,Mara,"Thanks, Hope. Couldn't ask for a better friend."
4,9,4,Light Hope,...Friend...
4,9,5,Mara,"Okay, Razz. Promise you'll stay away from the ship from now on."
4,9,5,Razz,"Sure thing, Adora. See you tomorrow!"
4,9,5,Mara,"No, you can't come back tomorrow! And why do you keep calling me Adora? Who's Adora? Razz--"
4,9,6,Adora,--Wait! There you are.
4,9,6,Adora,"Oh, it's a First Ones ruin. I told you Razz was taking me somewhere."
4,9,6,Adora,These marks were made with a sword.. ...Mara's sword. She was here... She did this.
4,9,6,Swift Wind,Wow. Mara did this? She really was crazy.
4,9,6,Razz,Aha! You found it!
4,9,6,Adora,Found what? What does it mean?
4,9,6,Razz,Sugar! Now we just need the berries!
4,9,6,Adora,Razz! This was left deliberately...did it belong to Mara?
4,9,6,Razz,"Oh, yes, dearie! She left it for you. She wants to talk to you."
4,9,6,Adora,...What?
4,9,6,Razz,"Come on, slowpoke! Help an old lady pick some berries."
4,9,6,Adora,"Razz, Mara's gone. She's been gone for a thousand years."
4,9,6,Razz,"Hmm? No, that doesn't sound right. She's helping me make a pie today. She promised, you know!"
4,9,6,Adora,"No, I'm helping you make a pie!"
4,9,6,Razz,"Yes, that's what I said."
4,9,6,Adora,"Razz, why is today the day we have to make pie?"
4,9,6,Razz,Because today is important.
4,9,6,Adora,But why is it important?
4,9,6,Razz,"Eh...it's important because, eh...because..."
4,9,7,Razz,Oh! Because I have to duck!
4,9,7,Mara,Watch out! For the Honor...of Grayskull!
4,9,7,Adora,"Razz, run!"
4,9,7,Razz,"Mara, no!"
4,9,7,Razz,Stop!
4,9,7,Razz,It's all right... No one here will hurt you.
4,9,7,Mara,"Go now. Be at peace. ...Razz? I-I'm sorry, I-I thought it was gonna hurt you, I--"
4,9,7,Razz,"That's all right, dearie. Come here."
4,9,7,Mara,Wha-what are you do--
4,9,7,Mara,How am I doing this? How is this possible without the sword?
4,9,7,Razz,She-Ra is not a sword! She-Ra is you! Etheria chose you.
4,9,7,Mara,But...my people chose me to be She-Ra. I need the sword to control She-Ra's magic. That's...what my superiors always told me.
4,9,7,Razz,She-Ra was here long before your people arrived. You cannot control magic! Magic simply is.
4,9,7,Mara,"I love Etheria. I love how old, and weird, and beautiful it is. I'm sworn to protect it as She-Ra, just as I'm sworn to serve my people, but... I know we're doing something to the planet. The Heart of Etheria Project... I don't know all the details, but I know it's big. They say we're the heroes, but... I don't know if it's right."
4,9,7,Razz,"She-Ra protects Etheria. Your people made the sword, but they did not make She-Ra."
4,9,8,Adora,What people?
4,9,8,Adora,Are you talking about the First Ones?
4,9,8,Razz,The sword... Mara... She said she would come back. She promised... We were going to make the pie. I've been waiting for so long.
4,9,8,Adora,"Mara... ...She was here, too, wasn't she? Everything we're doing--the berries, the sugar, making the pie--it helps you remember."
4,9,8,Razz,"Oh, Mara ...You were never supposed to succeed. They made a plan for you... Razz could not do anything to help. ...I am sorry."
4,9,8,Adora,"Then help me, Adora, not Mara."
4,9,8,Razz,"...Adora? Yes, Mara wanted me to warn Adora! There is a great evil at the Heart of Etheria, Adora, and it is waking up again. You need to talk to Mara! It's getting late. We have to hurry. We have to put the pie in!"
4,9,8,Adora,What?!
4,9,9,Razz,"Not much time, not much time..."
4,9,9,Adora,Okay...Razz... What was it you were just saying about the evil at the Heart of Etheria?
4,9,9,Razz,Eh? Doesn't ring a bell.
4,9,9,Adora,"What's at the Heart of Etheria? Light Hope said Mara snapped, but there's gotta be more to it than that! There was a reason why she broke everything, why she put us in Despondos. She was...afraid...of something. Was...was she afraid of the sword somehow? Of being She-Ra?"
4,9,9,Razz,"Oh, no time, there's no time."
4,9,9,Adora,"Please, Razz, you have to remember something!"
4,9,9,Razz,"Remember, remember... I try to remember but it gets all muddled up. Adora...Mara, I--it always ends the same. The present, the future--"
4,9,10,Mara,Razz?
4,9,10,Razz,"The past. Mara, dearie, you're just in time! The pie is almost--"
4,9,10,Mara,"I can't stay long, Razz."
4,9,10,Razz,"Nonsense, we're making pie today, or have you forgotten? Ah-ah-ah! And they say my memory is bad!"
4,9,10,Mara,"Razz, listen. I figured out what my people are doing with the Heart of Etheria..what they've done to the planet. It's going to activate soon, there's no time. I have to get to my ship... It's starting."
4,9,10,Razz,But...the pie...
4,9,10,Mara,"Tomorrow, Razz. We'll make a pie tomorrow, I promise."
4,9,10,Mara,I can't stop it....But I can keep them from hurting anyone else.
4,9,10,Razz,Mara!
4,9,11,Razz,It's time.
4,9,11,Adora,...Razz? Razz!
4,9,11,Swift Wind,What?!
4,9,11,Adora,"Come on, Swifty!"
4,9,11,Swift Wind,Where are we going?
4,9,11,Adora,The pie's done.
4,9,13,Razz,You're not Mara!
4,9,13,Bow,Ow! [rubbing his head[
4,9,13,Adora,Madame Razz!
4,9,13,Razz,"Adora, help me find Mara! You know where she is!"
4,9,13,Bow,Adora! Who's that lady?
4,9,13,Adora,"t's okay, it's just Razz."
4,9,13,Bow,Madame Razz?
4,9,13,Razz,Adora! You need to talk to Mara! You have everything you need.
4,9,13,Adora,I have everything I--
4,9,13,Bow,...What are you doing?
4,9,13,Adora,"Wait, I know this. She-Ra."
4,9,14,Light Hope,"What are you doing, Mara? You have de-de-destroyed my intraplanetary systems. You are beha-be-behaving erratically. Where is the sword, Mara?"
4,9,14,Mara,The sword is gone. There's not going to be a She-Ra anymore.
4,9,14,Light Hope,It is your destiny to be She-Ra.
4,9,14,Mara,She-Ra's destiny was to be a part of your machine. But I won't ever let you use her again.
4,9,14,Light Hope,The Heart of Etheria has been activated. Your mission will be fulfilled. There will be peace throughout the galaxy. You will be...a hero.
4,9,14,Mara,How will destroying worlds bring peace?
4,9,14,Light Hope,"You're trying to di-disable me. It will not work. The Heart of Etheria will achieve its function, as will you. You...are She-Ra. This is your destiny."
4,9,14,Mara,You're not Light Hope.
4,9,14,Light Hope,I am the same basic operating system.
4,9,14,Mara,You're not her. And you don't get to tell me what my destiny is. Activating portal into the dimension of Despondos in three... two... one...
4,9,15,Mara,...Adora?
4,9,15,Mara,I know you're there. Razz said you would be there.
4,9,15,Adora,Mara?
4,9,16,Mara,"I don't have much time, I barely made it out. If you are seeing this, it means you are the new She-Ra. It means I failed. I don't know what they told you, but it wasn't all bad at first. We were the first ones to settle Etheria, to really study this planet's magic. How could it go so wrong? You can't trust Light Hope. She's been reprogrammed to set off the weapon at any cost. The weapon..."
4,9,17,Adora,The weapon! What is it?
4,9,17,Mara,"I didn't know what they were doing until too late. I knew they were rerouting Etheria's magic for their own purposes...siphoning it, collecting it in the planet's core..."
4,9,17,Adora,The Heart of Etheria...
4,9,17,Mara,"The Heart of Etheria Project. It was supposed to be an energy source, capable of so much good...but that's not what they made. My people turned our planet, all of Etheria, into a weapon. And She-Ra is the key."
4,9,17,Adora,...What?
4,9,17,Mara,"I opened a portal to a completely empty dimension and pulled Etheria in. I hid us from the rest of the universe, to keep everyone safe. This is the one place they'll never find us. The weapon can't hurt anyone else here. I saw what they would do...the deaths that would follow...I couldn't stop them before, but I can now. Hiding is our only option. Adora...this isn't over. The Heart of Etheria is still siphoning magic, storing it. It's unstable, it will tear Etheria apart if it goes off again. So it's up to you now. I couldn't stop it. In the end, I wasn't strong enough. But you--Adora, you will be more powerful than they ever planned. Adora...I believe in you. You can save the world we love."
4,9,17,Adora,...The weapon... The weapon is Etheria. And Mara... sacrificed herself to save everyone.
4,9,17,Razz,"She was brave, my Mara. For you, Mara, dearie."
4,10,1,Shadow Weaver,Maintain the connection. That's right. Stay focused.
4,10,1,Double Trouble,Does this usually take so long? I never require this much rehearsal. Maybe sorcery just isn't your calling.
4,10,1,Shadow Weaver,Do not allow them to distract you.
4,10,1,Glimmer,"I did it. I mean, of course I did. It's a truth spell. Don't bother fighting it. Just tell me everything you know about the Horde's plans."
4,10,1,Double Trouble,"Yes. I can resist no longer. I shall tell you the truth. The truth is...that outfit really isn't working for you. Oh, and magic isn't either."
4,10,1,Double Trouble,"Aw. Your little spell failed. You believed my performance, though. I can tell. It's called acting. That's the real magic here."
4,10,1,Glimmer,Ugh.
4,10,1,Other,Adora has returned and called a meeting of the Princess Alliance.
4,10,1,Glimmer,Adora's back?
4,10,1,Double Trouble,Adora called a meeting? Can she do that? I thought you were the queen.
4,10,1,Double Trouble,I guess I should be working on my Adora impression. She's clearly the leader here. Hmm. Is the hair poof high enough?
4,10,1,Perfuma,That's really going to happen? To Etheria? To-- To us?
4,10,1,Bow,"The Heart of Etheria nearly destroyed everyone in Mara's time. And it's gotten stronger, more volatile over the centuries. If it goes off now...We have to make sure it never goes off again."
4,10,1,Frosta,"So, how do we stop it?"
4,10,1,Shadow Weaver,Stop it? The real question is how do you intend to use this to your advantage?
4,10,1,Adora,"Uh, we're not. You saw the simulation. We have to disable it."
4,10,1,Shadow Weaver,And throw away such power? Perhaps the First Ones were fools for storing so much raw energy at the heart of the planet. But now that it's there...
4,10,1,Glimmer,What if there was a way to channel that magic ourselves?
4,10,1,Shadow Weaver,"The princesses are powerful, but with that magic they would be unstoppable."
4,10,1,Glimmer,We'd be supercharged. We could take down the Horde.
4,10,1,Adora,Are you seriously considering this? You heard Bow. It's an unstable superweapon. Tampering with it is way too dangerous.
4,10,1,Glimmer,"Dangerous? Every day, the Horde claims more territory. We're running out of options. So I say we get Light Hope to tell us how it works, and take our power back."
4,10,1,Adora,All she wants is to set the weapon off. Are you even listening to us?
4,10,1,Bow,Okay. Five-minute break.
4,10,2,Catra,Scorpia?
4,10,2,Catra,Finally. What are you doing?
4,10,2,Lonnie,We just got back. The Eastern Quadrant is secured. No rebel activity.
4,10,2,Catra,"While you were out in the field, did you see anyone? Anything else?"
4,10,2,Lonnie,Just lots of tired soldiers.
4,10,2,Catra,"Get back out there, then."
4,10,2,Lonnie,"Catra, we already worked a double. We've been going without R and R for days now. We need sleep."
4,10,2,Catra,"Oh, I'm sorry, are you tired? We're all tired, but we're not going to rest until we have all of Etheria under our control. Everything is finally coming together. We're winning. So, get back out there. Problem?"
4,10,3,Bow,"I know we've lost a lot, but we can't--"
4,10,3,Glimmer,"Lost a lot? Elberon, Thaymor, Alwyn, Salineas. We've lost almost everything. This magic is the only thing that can help us save everyone."
4,10,3,Perfuma,Use the scary magical energy. Don't use the scary magical energy.
4,10,3,Frosta,Maybe we should continue this in the morning? Not that I'm up past my bedtime. I don't have a bedtime. I can go to bed whenever I want.
4,10,3,Mermista,Or we can just decide right now. I'll do whatever it takes to get my kingdom back. I say we use the magic.
4,10,3,Perfuma,"Oh, it's so dangerous. What if it goes off in the process? Oh, I don't know. Just come back to me. Use the scary magic or don't use the scary magic."
4,10,3,Swift Wind,How come I still don't have a chair even though the new person does?
4,10,3,Scorpia,"Oh, no. I'm sitting on Emily."
4,10,3,Adora,"Swift Wind, is this really the time to...?"
4,10,3,Glimmer,Uh...
4,10,3,Scorpia,"Hey, everybody. How are you? Gosh, I am so sorry for popping in unannounced. I didn't wanna interrupt. You all seemed really busy, so I snuck past the guards and was just waiting for you guys to notice I was here--"
4,10,3,Frosta,Horde soldier!
4,10,3,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
4,10,3,Scorpia,No. Do-- Hold on! Hold on! I don't wanna fight you.
4,10,3,Perfuma,She's got a bot!
4,10,3,Mermista,For Salineas!
4,10,3,Scorpia,Wait!
4,10,3,Frosta,You ruined Princess Prom!
4,10,3,Scorpia,"No, wait! Wat, wait, wait! No. Please! I don't wanna hurt you."
4,10,3,Perfuma,I think she's telling the tru--
4,10,3,Scorpia,I am so sorry. I did not mean to do that. It's instinct. It--Uh-oh. Please! I need your help to save Entrapta!
4,10,4,Catra,Scorpia? I knew you'd come-- Get it together!
4,10,4,Lonnie,"Okay, no. There's no way we're working a fourth--"
4,10,4,Catra,What are they saying?
4,10,4,Lonnie,What? Who?
4,10,4,Catra,Don't pretend like you don't know. Are they laughing at me?
4,10,4,Lonnie,"Mostly people are just tired. I think if you let them sleep, everything will be fine."
4,10,4,Catra,Everything isn't fine. Scorpia would be here if everything was fine.
4,10,4,Catra,Just leave. Like everybody else. Go! Double Trouble. Are you there? Come on. Answer me!
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Again, I am so sorry about the whole stinging thing."
4,10,5,Glimmer,"All right, Horde soldier."
4,10,5,Scorpia,Hmm?
4,10,5,Glimmer,Why are you here? Heh. Are you listening to me?
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Wow...Yeah, but just-- Shadow Weaver. And at Bright Moon. Everything is making so much sense about why Catra's been acting the way she has. And now I left. Oh, that's gonna do a real number on her."
4,10,5,Adora,Hey. Answer the question.
4,10,5,Scorpia,Right. Sorry. The thing is you all seem really good at friendship.
4,10,5,Perfuma,You're here to learn how to be a good friend?
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Yes. That's it. See, I thought I was being a good friend to Catra, but it turns out Catra wasn't being a good friend to me, and also that I have no idea what friendship is. Man, I think Entrapta's the only real friend I've ever had."
4,10,5,Scorpia,Oh. And Emily.
4,10,5,Mermista,Say things that make sense.
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Right. Okay. Entrapta wanted to warn Hordak about the whole, you know, portal weirdness thing, so Catra sent her to Beast Island, and I...I let it happen. Now I have to save her."
4,10,5,Adora,Beast Island? With the blood beetles? And the trees with razor-sharp blades instead of leaves? It's real?
4,10,5,Shadow Weaver,"Oh, yes. But it's much worse than that. We told you those children's stories so you wouldn't be scared."
4,10,5,Scorpia,"It's worse? Oh, what have I done?"
4,10,5,Adora,We can't leave her there.
4,10,5,Bow,"If we wanna safely disable the weapon, Entrapta's our best bet. She'd know more about that than anyone."
4,10,5,Glimmer,Wait--
4,10,5,Adora,"We have to get to Beast Island right away, save Entrapta, and shut down the Heart of Etheria for good."
4,10,5,Glimmer,Hold on.
4,10,5,Swift Wind,I'm in.
4,10,5,Glimmer,"No, you're not-- What?"
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Me, too. Obviously, I mean, I brought this to you."
4,10,5,Adora,"Great, then it's decided. We're going--"
4,10,5,Glimmer,Will everyone just stop for one second? You aren't going anywhere. You're our prisoner. And you! We need to talk about this. Now! Stop it. Stop just trying to barrel ahead with your own plans. We have to talk about this.
4,10,5,Adora,"What's there to talk about? Entrapta needs our help, and we need Entrapta."
4,10,5,Glimmer,"Adora, have you ever heard of anyone coming back from Beast Island? Do you even know where it is?"
4,10,5,Adora,No. But we have to try.
4,10,5,Glimmer,"Oh, great plan. The Horde's on our doorstep and we'll just drop everything to run off on a harebrained rescue mission."
4,10,5,Bow,"Glimmer, you do want to save Entrapta, right?"
4,10,5,Glimmer,Of course I do. We'll save her. But we need to stop the Horde first. I won't risk the whole Alliance for one princess who betrayed us.
4,10,5,Bow,There's an unstable mass of magic in the middle of the planet. Everyone's at risk unless we can get Entrapta to shut it down.
4,10,5,Glimmer,"Entrapta has a habit of exploding everything she touches. You really wanna let her near this thing? Just go to Light Hope and ask her. If we can get some of that stored power back, we could use it to defeat the Horde and save Entrapta."
4,10,5,Adora,"What? No. I told you, we can't trust her. She betrayed Mara. She lied to me. She's the bad guy!"
4,10,5,Glimmer,The Horde are the bad guys. And you don't have to tell her everything. Just find out how it works and how to access it.
4,10,5,Adora,And if it goes wrong? People could get hurt.
4,10,5,Glimmer,"Bow. You understand what I'm trying to say, tell her."
4,10,5,Bow,No. You weren't there. We need Entrapta. We need to disable the weapon.
4,10,5,Glimmer,Why can't you just trust me in this?
4,10,5,Bow,Because you're WRONG!
4,10,5,Glimmer,You think I'm wrong? Fine. But I am still queen. And as queen I am ordering you. No one is going to Beast Island. You're not to set foot outside the castle unless I say so. End of discussion.
4,10,5,Scorpia,Oh.
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Ha, ha. Hang--Hang on. I get to stay here?"
4,10,5,Frosta,This is the only other spare room we have. But don't go thinking it's a sleepover. We're guarding you.
4,10,5,Perfuma,I brought snacks. Thought you might be hungry after your journey.
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Okay. What is that? Why is it green and not bar-shaped? Are you trying to poison me? And if not, why are you being so nice?"
4,10,5,Perfuma,"It's green because it's a vegetable, silly. Do they not have those in the Horde? Oh. Well, okay, you should definitely be eating them. And we're being nice because you're our guest."
4,10,5,Frosta,Prisoner. I said it's not a sleepo--
4,10,5,Perfuma,I'll get pillows. Be right back. Aah!
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Oh. Mm-mm. Blah, blah, blah."
4,10,5,Scorpia,Wh-- What?
4,10,5,Frosta,How strong are your pincers? Can you crush things or just cut?
4,10,5,Scorpia,"Oh, you know, they're good for general pincing. And cutting through basically everything."
4,10,5,Frosta,Really? I gotta try that.
4,10,5,Frosta,Oh. Are you--? Are you crying? Is it because I made ice pincers? I'm sorry. They're your thing. I get it.
4,10,5,Scorpia,"No, it's not that. The Horde always told me I was different, that I wouldn't fit in with you at all, but you're making me feel the opposite of not belonging, which I guess is belonging?"
4,10,5,Frosta,"I used to feel that way, too. And then I met Glimmer and the others, and I realized that none of us fit in. We're all different, but that's okay."
4,10,5,Scorpia,That might be the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
4,10,5,Frosta,"Well, don't get used to it. You're still our prisoner. But I've got first watch, so I'll be up, if you wanna talk more."
4,10,6,Hordak,I've taken the last of the coastal towns. What is the status in the Woods?
4,10,6,Catra,"Our raiding parties have crushed the villages near our current outpost. Tomorrow, we move farther inland. Everything is under control."
4,10,6,Hordak,Excellent. Etheria will be ours yet.
4,10,7,Bow,"I've never lied to Glimmer before. I mean, it's not ""lying"" lying. I left a note. Three, actually. But still."
4,10,7,Adora,"We're doing the right thing. We can't let what happened in Mara's time ever happen again. And Glimmer's gonna be angry at us, but at least she'll be around to be angry."
4,10,7,Bow,Do you think I should leave another note?
4,10,7,Adora,"Uh, Bow. We're kind of sneaking out here. You think you could keep it down a little?"
4,10,7,Bow,Sorry.
4,10,7,Swift Wind,"Hey, Adora! I kicked open the last barn door I could and I am ready to go!"
4,10,7,Adora,"Swifty, you gotta keep it down."
4,10,7,Frosta,What's happening?
4,10,7,Bow,"Uh... You're asleep? Yeah, you're asleep. This is a dream. A dream."
4,10,7,Swift Wind,Yes. The flying unicorn dream. Classic.
4,10,7,Frosta,I know what you're doing.
4,10,7,Frosta,And you better hurry.
4,10,7,Adora,You're--? You're not gonna stop us?
4,10,7,Frosta,"I didn't join the Princess Alliance just to fight. I joined to save people. And the Horde, even after everything they did...they're people, just like us. I'll cover for you, but you have to go now. Everyone will be up soon."
4,10,7,Adora,Should I be doing anything or...?
4,10,7,Bow,"Um...Not sure. Gonna be honest, I've never flown a spaceship."
4,10,7,Swift Wind,I know how to fly. Just have this thing flap its wings. There's gotta be a flapping wings button.
4,10,7,Bow,"No, no, no!"
4,10,7,Adora,"Wait, Swifty, dont--"
4,10,7,Swift Wind,"Never mind, that wasn't it. Down's the opposite of the direction we want to go in!"
4,10,7,Bow,"We know that, Swift Wind!"
4,10,7,Adora,Bow! Do something!
4,10,7,Swift Wind,Loop-de-loops! How could you betray me?
4,10,7,Other,Administrator detected. What is your query?
4,10,7,Adora,Fly ship! How to fly ship.
4,10,7,Bow,Just take us back down gently!
4,10,7,Other,Acknowledged. Going in reverse.
4,10,7,Bow,"No, no, no!"
4,10,7,Adora,Stop!
4,10,7,Other,Please state navigational course.
4,10,7,Adora,Uh... Beast Island?
4,10,7,Other,"Setting coordinates for Hazardous Materials Disposal Site. Designation, Beast Island. Coordinates set. Is any additional assistance required?"
4,10,7,Adora,Can you maybe fly us there?
4,10,7,Other,Affirmative. Setting autopilot.
4,10,7,Bow,Wow. That was a lot easier than I thought it'd be.
4,10,8,Double Trouble,"Oh, back again? You know what they say, if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try. How many times have you tried again?"
4,10,8,Glimmer,Tell me everything.
4,10,8,Double Trouble,"I--I--I can't cry on cue. Whenever a role calls for tears, the only thing that works is thinking about children falling. They're tears of laughter, but no one can tell the difference. I've never told anyone that before."
4,10,8,Glimmer,Tell me the Horde's plans.
4,10,8,Double Trouble,"Oh, is that all? Why didn't you just say so? Catra and Hordak are worked up because Horde Prime is on his way with his armada. To conquer all of Etheria."
4,10,8,Glimmer,When?
4,10,8,Double Trouble,"Any day now, darling. I'd say it's curtains for your little rebellion here. But, hey, while this truth spell is still working, here's on more for you. If you're already losing to Hordak, you poor lambs don't stand a chance against Horde Prime."
4,10,8,Glimmer,No. Adora! Bow!
4,10,8,Shadow Weaver,You can still stop them.
4,10,8,Glimmer,"Let them go. If they don't trust me, I don't trust them. Horde Prime is coming. We need to be ready for him. I'm gonna figure out how to access the magic at the Heart of Etheria, and how to use it. And I'll do it alone if I have to."
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"Are you sure we're going the right way? Like, 100 percent sure?"
4,11,0,Adora,"For the last time, I don't know. We have to trust that the navigation system knows what it's doing. Now stop asking."
4,11,0,Bow,We've got to be close. Any minute now. Beast Island is around here. Somewhere.
4,11,0,Adora,We will find it. We have to.
4,11,0,Bow,"Do you think Glimmer will still be upset when we get back? We did sort of, kind of, completely disobey direct orders"
4,11,0,Adora,"She'll understand. We all want what's best for Etheria. And once we get Entrapta back, Glimmer will know we made the right decision."
4,11,0,Bow,"Right, but—I mean what if she doesn't? What if she never talks to me again?"
4,11,0,Adora,"Uh, Bow? The thing that's blinking, should it be blinking?"
4,11,0,Bow,"Uhh, I don't know, a ship?"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"Uh, guys, I'm sensing something out there. Something big, and it's not good. And I think I hear—"
4,11,0,Bow,"Don't panic, no one panic."
4,11,0,Bow,"Uh, nope! Never mind, Panic!"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Ehh
4,11,0,Adora,Look. It's Beast Island.
4,11,0,Adora,"As kids, we were warned of the dangers of Beast Island. There were the Chibbits with razor-sharp teeth, Scruffers with razor-sharp horns, Razorfins with—"
4,11,0,Bow,Razor-sharp fins?!
4,11,0,Adora,"Razor-sharp teeth, actually. I don't know why it had that name"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Adora! Okay! That's normal.
4,11,0,Adora,Entrapta. She must have been on it.
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Where do you think she went?
4,11,0,Swift Wind,What is that noise?
4,11,0,Bow,What noise?
4,11,0,Swift Wind,It's gone You didn't hear it?
4,11,0,Bow,"Uh, any scary Horde bedtime stories about noises only horses can hear?"
4,11,0,Adora,Not that I can remember.
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"I heard the same sound earlier, right before Mara's ship crashed."
4,11,0,Bow,"First Ones' tech. This is all First Ones' tech. But it's corrupted, melted down. This must've been some kind of First Ones' dumping ground"
4,11,0,Adora,We should get moving while we still have light. Entrapta's here somewhere.
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"On this awful nightmare island, which we went to on purpose, so everything's great. Hey, let's take a fun stroll through nightmare island, just kidding, it's definitely not weird and scary. I wanna go home."
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Maybe everything went quiet... for a good reason.
4,11,0,Adora,"Nope, a bad reason."
4,11,0,Bow,"Okay, no one move. Maybe it won't see us."
4,11,0,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
4,11,0,Bow,Uh... Adora?
4,11,0,Adora,Run!
4,11,0,Bow,What happened? Why can't you be She-Ra?
4,11,0,Adora,I don't know!
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"There it is again, that sound."
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"Really, no one else hears that?"
4,11,0,Adora,"No! Come on, come on. For the honor of Grayskull!"
4,11,0,Bow,Adora!
4,11,0,Bow,Woah.
4,11,0,Adora,"Who is that guy? Thank you, you saved us. Who—?"
4,11,0,Bow,King Micah.
4,11,0,Glimmer,"Light Hope? The queen of Bright Moon demands to speak to Light Hope. Now. On behalf of the Great Rebellion, I need you to answer my questions. Eternia? Okay I know you can hear me. So that's how it is. Fine. I'll just have to make you listen."
4,11,0,Light Hope,Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol activated.
4,11,0,Glimmer,You're not getting rid of me that easily.
4,11,0,Adora,Your Majesty
4,11,0,Micah,Huh? You know who I am? Please don't kneel. I'm no king here.
4,11,0,Adora,"Of course we know. Oh, uh I'm Adora, and this is Swift Wind and Bow."
4,11,0,Bow,"King Micah, It's so great to— —meet you."
4,11,0,Micah,"Huh. Apologies. It's been... quite some time since I've talked to anyone else. Anyone real, that is. And you are real, Right?!"
4,11,0,Bow,"Very real. Huh, yeah. Hi. Uh... Are you real? I mean, we kinda thought you were dead."
4,11,0,Micah,"If the horde had their way, I would be. They exiled me here, but I survived!"
4,11,0,Adora,"King Micah, we're from Bright Moon. We know your daughter, Glimmer."
4,11,0,Micah,"My sweet Glimmer? Huh? There's no time for pleasantries! We have to move quick, follow me!"
4,11,0,Bow,Woah.
4,11,0,Micah,"We should be able to rest here for a moment. A safe, quiet mo—"
4,11,0,Micah,Gotcha! Oh— I'm so sorry. Where are my manners? Bug?
4,11,0,Adora,"Uh, mmh. No."
4,11,0,Micah,"So, what brings you to Beast Island?"
4,11,0,Adora,"Uh, We came here looking for our friend, Princess Entrapta. Any chance you've seen her? She's got purple hair and really like robots. Like, realy, really likes robots."
4,11,0,Micah,"Yeah, I know her. She stole my rations. Only the tiny ones for some reason."
4,11,0,Adora,"That's great! I mean, not the food part, but the other part. She's okay, or she was not long ago."
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Did you see which way she went?
4,11,0,Micah,"Why yes, sh— Is that horse talking?!"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"I can hear you. I'm swift wind, and I—"
4,11,0,Micah,It has wings!
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"Well, this is definitely Glimmer's dad."
4,11,0,Bow,"Your Majesty, could you let me go?"
4,11,0,Micah,"Huh? Oh, right. Sorry. Like I said, it's been a little while since I've talked to people, or horses. Because horses talk now, and that's normal."
4,11,0,Adora,You were saying something about Entrapta. Do you know where she is?
4,11,0,Micah,Yes. Your friend headed straight for the center of the island before I could stop her.
4,11,0,Bow,Sounds like Entrapta. Could you point us in the direction—
4,11,0,Micah,You can't go there! You'd never come back. It's where the signal is the strongest.
4,11,0,Swift Wind,The signal. That must be the noise I've been hearing. What is it?
4,11,0,Micah,"You've heard it? Then we have to hurry. This place is a mass of ancient tech, mostly degraded but some of it still works. And something at the center of that island never stopped signaling. The signal dulls your resolve, exposes your vulnerabilities, it pulls you in. Everything that stays on Beast Island becomes a part of it eventually."
4,11,0,Bow,Why can't Adora and I hear it?
4,11,0,Micah,"Stay here long enough, and you will. I've heard it every day, for months, years. I have no sense of time here. But I fight it! Nothing ill stop me from getting off this island and reuniting with my family. But enough about me. Tell me news of the Rebellion and Bright Moon. And my baby girl. You know her?"
4,11,0,Adora,"Glimmer? Sure. She's... Well, she's—"
4,11,0,Bow,She's our best friend. We're the Best Friend Squad.
4,11,0,Micah,Sounds like my baby girl. Hm. Always in a hurry to grow up and be friends with the older kids. What about Angella? Have you seen her?
4,11,0,Adora,"Your Majesty, I—"
4,11,0,Bow,What is that?
4,11,0,Micah,"We should keep moving. I'll help you find your friend, and then, can you help me escape this place?"
4,11,0,Bow,Of course. We'll all get out of here together.
4,11,0,Micah,Then why are we waiting? Follow me!
4,11,0,Micah,"So you're telling me that horses are now allowed in the War Room, and they all get chairs?"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,"Big, important chairs, yep! And also, unlimited sugar cubes."
4,11,0,Micah,"Eh, sounds good to me."
4,11,0,Adora,"I can't believe Glimmer's dad has been alive this whole time. And he's so cool. A Little weird, but I guess that's to be expected after all this time alone."
4,11,0,Bow,"Glimmer will be so happy to see her dad again. She'll have to forgive us for going against her orders, escaping Bright Moon, and taking Mara's ship. Not that we technically did anything wrong, or need to be forgiven. I mean, Glimmer kept us in the dark. The truth is she hasn't been a good friend. But have we been? Can you even have a fight with a best friend and still be best friends? And don't get me started on Shadow Weaver. Are you okay?"
4,11,0,Adora,"Yeah, it's just— Why can't I be She-Ra here? What if something on this island infected the sword, or what if Glimmer is right an-an-and all I do is ruin everything? I... I just feel useless."
4,11,0,Bow,"Hey, you aren't useless. We'll figure this out. You're still a hero, I'm still a tech master, Swift Wind's still—"
4,11,0,Swift Wind,Woo-hoo! That's not food!
4,11,0,Bow,He's still a horse. But now we've got Cool Sorcerer Dad helping us.
4,11,0,Adora,You're right.
4,11,0,Glimmer,"Are you gonna send more spiders for me to destroy, or are you gonna talk to me? The First Ones stole the magic of Etheria, the magic of my people. Please, talk to me! That magic is how I stop this war. It's how I save everyone. That magic, the magic at the Heart of Etheria... I want to use it."
4,11,0,Light Hope,"Temporary administrator access granted to Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon. Queen Glimmer, proceed."
4,11,1,Swift Wind,The signal...it's getting... stronger...
4,11,1,Micah,"We're getting closer. Don't let it distract you. Tell me... what is she like, my Glimmer?"
4,11,1,Bow,Stubborn. Real stubborn.
4,11,1,Adora,Bow.
4,11,1,Bow,What?
4,11,1,Adora,"She's also brave! She's one of the bravest people I know. I just--wanna be the hero she deserves, and I... I don't know if I have been."
4,11,1,Micah,"Great, great. Oh, and does she still have her favorite stuffed animal? The one I made for her--Kowl?"
4,11,1,Adora,"Oh, yeah. She's even started to use your sorcerer staff."
4,11,1,Micah,I-i--isn't that kind of dangerous for a little...kid?
4,11,1,Bow,"Try telling her that. Not like she listens to anyone these days, that is except for Sha--"
4,11,1,Bow,What is that?
4,11,1,Micah,It's the pookas.
4,11,1,Bow,"Pookas? That sounds adorable! Let me guess, more razor-sharp scary things?"
4,11,1,Micah,"Pookas travel in packs, hunting their prey across the island, luring them in and surrounding them until it's too late. And right now, they're hunting us."
4,11,1,Micah,Run!
4,11,1,Bow,We never should have come here without Glimmer! She could've teleported us out in a second! Why couldn't she just trust us?! Why couldn't she trust me?!
4,11,1,Micah,Glimmer's in the field?! She's fighting? She's too young. Angella shouldn't have let her--
4,11,1,Micah,"Tell me the truth. Glimmer's not a little girl anymore, is she? ...How long have I been gone?!"
4,11,1,Swift Wind,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, silence is always for a bad reason!"
4,11,1,Adora,Where did they go?
4,11,1,Bow,Aww. It's kind of cute.
4,11,1,Bow,But mainly scary!
4,11,1,Micah,I told you!
4,11,1,Adora,Swift Wind!
4,11,1,Adora,Swift Wind! Wait!
4,11,1,Swift Wind,I--
4,11,1,Adora,Hang on--
4,11,1,Swift Wind,"The signal... You hear it, too, now, don't you? It's so loud... I can't... think straight..."
4,11,1,Adora,"No! Swift Wind, we have to keep going, they're right behind us."
4,11,1,Micah,We can't stay! The signal's too strong! The pookas lured us right into a trap. We have to move!
4,11,1,Micah,Bow!
4,11,1,Adora,"Bow! No, not you, too! You have to fight it!"
4,11,1,Bow,"It's too late, isn't it? ...We couldn't fix it."
4,11,1,Adora,"No! We can still get out of here! Micah, help him!"
4,11,1,Adora,King Micah!
4,11,1,Adora,"Don't give in now, not after all this time! We'll get you back to Bright Moon! Glimmer needs you to come home and help her be queen and--"
4,11,1,Micah,"Queen? If she's queen, then that means..."
4,11,1,Adora,"No, no! King Micah! Bow! Swifty! Please, I can't do this alone! I can't-- I can't-- I can't do this... Glimmer was right..."
4,11,1,Adora,"I won't give up! Not on my friends, not on Etheria, not on myself! For the Honor of Grayskull!"
4,11,1,Bow,You did it! You're She-Ra again!
4,11,1,Micah,She-Ra...
4,11,1,Adora,"It wasn't the signal that was blocking me from being She-Ra... It was me. I was afraid of what Glimmer said...that all I've ever done was make things worse. But I promised I'd take care of her... ...take care of everyone, and I will."
4,11,1,Micah,"So, you're the legendary warrior She-Ra, and my daughter is...Queen?"
4,11,1,Adora,"There's a lot we need to catch you up on, Your Majesty. But first, let's go save our friends."
4,11,1,Bow,"Woo-hoo! Yeah! We did it! Take that, you terrifying yet adorably-named creatures!"
4,11,1,Adora,Get behind me!
4,11,1,Entrapta,Princesses! I saved you!
4,11,2,Glimmer,Light Hope? Is that you?
4,11,2,Light Hope,The Crystal Castle is intended only for She-Ra and her steed. You are trespassing.
4,11,2,Glimmer,"Well...She-Ra's not here right now. She took Bow and ran off on another stupid mission, and left me... ...left us all behind. She's too afraid to use the magic at the Heart of Etheria...but I'm not."
4,11,2,Light Hope,Perhaps entrusting She-Ra with this mission was a mistake. Adora is compromised. She is not willing to do what is necessary to protect Etheria...but you are.
4,11,2,Glimmer,Yes.
4,11,2,Light Hope,"Adora has made much progress, but she still has not succeeded in balancing Etheria. If the planet is not balanced, the Heart of Etheria cannot be accessed."
4,11,2,Glimmer,"Balance the planet... What does that mean? And, how do I do that?"
4,11,2,Light Hope,There is only one piece still missing. The princesses are conduits for the Heart's power. They must all be connected to their Runestones for the Heart of Etheria to function.
4,11,2,Glimmer,And that will make us stronger?
4,11,2,Light Hope,It will give you power like you've never known. The final piece is a princess who has not yet accepted her destiny...
4,11,3,Light Hope,A princess robbed of her power by the Horde's meddling.
4,12,0,Shadow Weaver,Please keep your bot out of my flower beds.
4,12,0,Scorpia,"Oh! Oh, sorry about that."
4,12,0,Scorpia,"Emily! Emily, come here!"
4,12,0,Scorpia,No! Not in the skull plant things!
4,12,0,Scorpia,"So uh, they let you have your own garden here? Aren't you a prisoner? Am I prisoner? Everyone's been so nice. How come we're not, you know, in a prison? Is this garden a prison?"
4,12,0,Shadow Weaver,"It wasn't, until today.
Scorpia: Oh! Heh, heh! Right, right, sorry!"
4,12,0,Scorpia,I-I'm not even here! Just a garden away..
4,12,0,Scorpia,"Emily! What did I just say? I said, stay out of the skull plants!"
4,12,0,Scorpia,"Bad bot! Bad! I said, drop it!"
4,12,1,Glimmer,Scorpia!
4,12,1,Shadow Weaver,"Your majesty, you're back. Did you find what you were looking for?"
4,12,1,Glimmer,"Yes. Light Hope told me everything I need to know, and I have a plan."
4,12,1,Shadow Weaver,"A plan? Excellent, we should discuss-"
4,12,1,Glimmer,"Scorpia, I need your help."
4,12,1,Scorpia,Me?
4,12,1,Glimmer,You're the only person who can save Etheria. We need you to reconnect to the Black Garnet.
4,12,1,Shadow Weaver,"What? Your majesty, I don't understand. We should reconvene with the other princesses and-"
4,12,1,Glimmer,The other princesses are gone. But it's fine!
4,12,1,Shadow Weaver,Gone?
4,12,1,Glimmer,I said it's fine. I have a plan-
4,12,1,Scorpia,Gone where?
4,12,1,Glimmer,"Okay, would anyone else like to interrupt me?"
4,12,1,Other,"I'm sorry your majesty, but Double Trouble has escaped."
4,12,3,Entrapta,"Wow, I can't believe we're all here on Beast Island at the same time. What an incredible coincidence."
4,12,3,Bow,Uh... It's not a coincidence. We came to find you.
4,12,3,Entrapta,"Beast Island Log, tide cycle 37. I have confirmed that the outside world still exists. I founded princesses! Well, one princess, some sort of horse bird-hybrid, Bow, and..."
4,12,3,Entrapta,I don't know you.
4,12,3,Micah,Yes you do. You stole my food.
4,12,3,Entrapta,Oh yeah! It was delicious!
4,12,3,Entrapta,Wasn't there another one of you?
4,12,3,Bow,Yes. Glimmer. You know her. And she's... not here.
4,12,3,Swift Wind,Can we talk about how I'm not a bird?
4,12,3,Adora,"Entrapta, we have been looking all over on this island for you. Are you ok?"
4,12,3,Entrapta,"Of course I'm ok! Have you seen this place? An Island, full of technological monstrosities, each more deadly than the next? Its paradise!"
4,12,3,Bow,"Yeah, um, glad you're having fun, but we're kind of here to rescue you?"
4,12,3,Entrapta,Rescue me? Did I not just rescue you?
4,12,3,Adora,Yeah.. that didn't go as planned.
4,12,3,Bow,"We came to bring you back. We would've come sooner, but we had no idea you were here. We though you were still with Hordak."
4,12,3,Bow,Scorpia told us what happened. She and the other princesses are waiting for you at Bright Moon.
4,12,3,Adora,"Entrapta, please. We need your help. We discovered what the First Ones and what they were doing to Etheria, a terrible secret that no one else knows."
4,12,3,Entrapta,You mean The Heart of Etheria? Why didn't you just say so?
4,12,4,Lonnie,Sorry. We didn't know you were in here. We'll just come back later.
4,12,4,Catra,Wait.
4,12,4,Catra,What's the report from the field?
4,12,4,Lonnie,"We just got back from conquering another rebel town! The third one this week. So, you're welcome."
4,12,4,Kyle,"Ah, you should've seen us! I was all:"
4,12,4,Kyle,"And then Rogelio, he was all:"
4,12,4,Catra,Watch it!
4,12,4,Lonnie,Calm down Catra! It's not like Scorpia needs it anymore.
4,12,4,Catra,You don't get to talk to me like that. I'm your commander. Got it?
4,12,4,Lonnie,What is wrong with you? We're winning! Even you should be happy.
4,12,4,Catra,Happy?
4,12,4,Catra,I'll be happy when the Rebellion and She-Ra are gone for good! But that's never going to happen with the three of you goofing off all the time. You are pathetic!
4,12,4,Kyle,Stay away from her!
4,12,4,Kyle,We used to be your friends. Why are you treating us like this?
4,12,4,Catra,Get out!
4,12,4,Double Trouble,Ouch! It's worse than I thought. You're a mess.
4,12,4,Catra,"Double Trouble? Y-You came back? I mean, where were you? I thought um-"
4,12,4,Double Trouble,You thought I left you?
4,12,4,Double Trouble,"Apologies for the delay, Kitten. I got held up in Bright Moon. But don't worry, I brought something that might cheer you up."
4,12,4,Catra,Better be something good after all that.
4,12,4,Double Trouble,"The time to strike the final blow to the Rebellion is upon us. The princesses aren't getting along, and most deliciously, She-Ra is gone."
4,12,4,Double Trouble,So..
4,12,4,Catra,Bright Moon is unprotected.
4,12,4,Double Trouble,Told you it would cheer you up.
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,We must find Double Trouble at once. They know too much! We can't let them return to the Fright Zone!
4,12,5,Glimmer,Forget Double Trouble. They don't matter anymore. The only person we need is right here.
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,Scorpia is not a true princess. She has never shown any connection to her Runestone.
4,12,5,Glimmer,"But she will, as soon as we get her to the Black Garnet."
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,"Get her to the Black Garnet? Your majesty, you're not thinking this through. You cannot go to the Fright Zone now! You are without allies, without your prisoner, and without a plan!"
4,12,5,Glimmer,I have a plan!
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,"My queen, listen to me. Think. Have I not only tried to help you?"
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,You are letting your emotions get the better of you. This plan is too risky. What would your mother say if she were here?
4,12,5,Glimmer,"You don't get to talk to me about my mother. Besides. You, were the one who told me to decide what kind of queen I am. And I've decided. I'm the queen who's going to save Etheria."
4,12,5,Shadow Weaver,My queen.
4,12,6,Hordak,What is the meaning of this?
4,12,6,Catra,"Oh sorry, I though you wanted to defeat the Rebellion. Because this is what that looks like."
4,12,6,Hordak,We are already spread thin from occupying so much territory.
4,12,6,Catra,"We're occupying plenty. But not Bright Moon. Not yet. Double Trouble reported in. The princesses are in chaos, She-Ra is gone, and without their precious hero to protect the castle, well.."
4,12,6,Hordak,we can strike the final blow to the Rebellion. When Bright Moon falls we will control all of Etheria.
4,12,6,Catra,Big brothers going to be so impressed.
4,12,6,Hordak,"Yes. This will show him what I am capable of. What we are capable of. Good work, Catra."
4,12,6,Hordak,Victory is ours.
4,12,7,Swift Wind,"I don't like it here. The signal, it's getting louder again. I think we should go."
4,12,7,Micah,The talking horse is right. We should stay away. No one ever comes back from this part of the island.
4,12,7,Entrapta,"Don't worry about the signal, it's better inside."
4,12,7,Bow,Inside where?
4,12,7,Bow,Wha-
4,12,7,Entrapta,Somewhere...
4,12,7,Entrapta,A-ha! Ta da!
4,12,7,Entrapta,Come on! You're going to love it.
4,12,7,Swift Wind,"Wow, this place is terrible. I hate it."
4,12,7,Adora,It's a First Ones Temple.
4,12,7,Entrapta,"Isn't it amazing? The First Ones tried to their secrets by dumping them on Beast Island! The answers I've been looking for, they're all here!"
4,12,7,Entrapta,"My theories were correct. I knew the First Ones had retrofitted the planet with tech, I just didn't know why. But it all makes sense now! They were mining the planet's magic, using it to power their weapon, The Heart of Etheria!"
4,12,7,Entrapta,"But of course you know all about The Heart of Etheria already, seeing as you're apart of it."
4,12,7,Adora,"Wait, wait. Hang on. What?"
4,12,7,Entrapta,"All the princesses are. Hang on, I'll show you."
4,12,7,Entrapta,"The Heart draws its power from the magic of the princesses. It needs all their Runestones engaged to work. And She-Ra is the most important piece, the key! She channels the weapon's power and focuses it."
4,12,7,Entrapta,She-Ra is the only being strong enough to withstand the destructive energy of The Heart.
4,12,7,Entrapta,"So the First Ones made the sword to control her, to use her."
4,12,7,Entrapta,"When The Heart is deployed, She-Ra will raise her sword and fire it!"
4,12,7,Adora,"She-Ra is the key.. That means I can stop it, right? If She-Ra fires the weapon, then I just won't do it."
4,12,7,Adora,"Please, Entrapta, tell me I can stop it!"
4,12,7,Entrapta,"Once the planet is balanced, no one can stop it. Not even the First Ones could control it. That's why they left. When the weapon is activated it will channel all its power into you. You don't get to refuse."
4,12,7,Bow,But Etheria isn't balanced yet. Look! There's still one Runestone offline. We might still have a chance. Wait.
4,12,7,Bow,The Black Garnet. Scorpia.
4,12,7,Adora,Scorpia's with the Rebellion. You don't think Glimmer would-?
4,12,7,Bow,There's no way she would know Scorpia's the final piece. Right?
4,12,7,Adora,We have to get back to Bright Moon.
4,12,8,Glimmer,Scorpia! We need to go to the Black Garnet chamber now. My plan is going to work!
4,12,8,Glimmer,What's wrong? I thought you would want to be a princess?
4,12,8,Scorpia,"Ok. I have been considering, I really appreciate the offer, but, I only came here to help Entrapta. I left the Horde, but I'm not gonna betray them. Or Catra."
4,12,8,Glimmer,"This will save them. Horde Prime could be here at any moment. If he shows up and we're not ready to defend ourselves, everyone loses. Do you really think he'll need to keep Catra around?"
4,12,8,Glimmer,We both want to save the people we love. But I can't do it without you.
4,12,8,Scorpia,It's hopeless.. What if the Black Garnet doesn't want me? I just.. kind of get rejected a lot.
4,12,8,Glimmer,"Tell me about it. My best friends left me. Even before this, I was the weak princess, the one who had to recharge. Who didn't fit. But that's changed now. We've changed now. We're stronger than anyone knows. We can do this. We can save everyone."
4,12,8,Scorpia,Everyone?
4,12,8,Glimmer,You're not hopeless. You were born for this. And I'll help you. We're in this together. You're going to make a great princess.
4,12,8,Scorpia,"Sorry, that was probably too much. Oh wow still going."
4,12,8,Scorpia,I'm in. So what now?
4,12,8,Glimmer,"Now, we go to save the world."
4,12,9,Micah,"What's going on, is Glimmer in danger?"
4,12,9,Bow,She might be. We have to get back as soon as we can.
4,12,9,Micah,"We're going home now? That's great! Wait, should I bring something back for Glimmer? What does she like? Does she like bugs?"
4,12,9,Swift Wind,"Oh, Micah. No one likes bug."
4,12,9,Entrapta,Have a good trip. Come again soon!
4,12,9,Adora,"Entrapta, no. You're coming with us."
4,12,9,Entrapta,"This place.. It's pure information. Everything I've ever dreamed of knowing about the planet, it's all here. So I'm staying."
4,12,9,Adora,No. We're not going to leave you.
4,12,9,Swift Wind,"Oh, this is not good."
4,12,9,Entrapta,Everything back there with the princesses and then... with Hordak.. was so.. confusing. I just wasn't suited for friendship. I belong here.
4,12,9,Bow,"Entrapta, please! Fight it!"
4,12,9,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
4,12,9,Adora,Head for the ship!
4,12,9,Micah,This way!
4,12,9,Entrapta,Just leave me!
4,12,9,Bow,"Entrapta, no! The island is affecting you. You can't give in!"
4,12,9,Entrapta,"You don't understand, that's okay... no one understands me... I tried to be a good friend. But I didn't understand that either."
4,12,9,Bow,What? Did you think friendship was easy? It takes work to be there for other people! It takes everything you've got.
4,12,9,Entrapta,Everyone leaves me behind... why should it be any different now?
4,12,9,Bow,"Because we're not ever going to leave you behind again! And we never gave up on you, even when you were with the Horde! Because that's what friends do."
4,12,9,Entrapta,You haven't... given up on me?
4,12,9,Adora,We're out of time!
4,12,9,Adora,"Entrapta, we flew here on an ancient First Ones ship. Do you want to see it or not?"
4,12,9,Entrapta,A ship? You have a First Ones spacecraft? A First Ones spacecraft that works??
4,12,9,Entrapta,I WANNA SEE!
4,12,9,Swift Wind,"Uh, hate to interrupt, but there's more monsters coming.. Like a lot more!"
4,12,9,Bow,Did anything I said about friendship work for you? Or was it all the ship?
4,12,9,Entrapta,"Oh definitely the ship. But, thank you. I'm-I'm glad we're friends."
4,12,9,Adora,"Guys, we really have to go!"
4,12,9,Swift Wind,To the ship!
4,12,9,Entrapta,"Get em' girl! I'll be back for you, I promise!"
4,12,10,Adora,You got me!
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"Ugh. I know, I know. No one is welcome in Hordak's super-secret sanctum."
4,12,10,Double Trouble,Not since you let that princess in.
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"What makes something a sanctum, anyway?"
4,12,10,Double Trouble,No small talk? I thought I'd at least get a pat on the back for my daring escape.
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"It's too bad, though."
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"I was looking forward to meeting this Entrapta character before I left Bright Moon. But of course, as you know, she wasn't there."
4,12,10,Hordak,What did you say?
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"Oh, you don't need keep up the charade with me. I figured out the truth. You had Catra send Entrapta to Beast Island, so She-Ra would run off to rescue her. A brilliant idea! The perfect distraction. I have to applaud your work, you really had me going. So scorned by Entrapta's betrayal. ...Even now you look like you had no idea!"
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"Brava. I mean, I did consider the alternative... That Catra's been lying to you this whole time."
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"That she made you think she was your partner in crime, while really she is the one who betrayed you .."
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"But between you and me, there's no way she's that good of an actor."
4,12,10,Double Trouble,"Well, I'll leave you to it. Congrats again. Great work all around."
4,12,11,Entrapta,Hellooo! It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! How does it work?? What does this button do? I'm going to push it and find out!
4,12,11,Bow,Mm. Take us home to Bright Moon.
4,12,11,Micah,Huh? This is actually real?
4,12,11,Bow,Um.. Yes. Remember we did the pinching thing already?
4,12,11,Micah,"Well, still, I couldn't let myself believe... Is it all true?"
4,12,11,Micah,We're really going home? And this horse really talks?
4,12,12,Double Trouble,Too easy.. As usual.
4,12,13,Glimmer,Are you ready?
4,12,13,Scorpia,Not really.
4,12,13,Micah,Bright Moon. I'm really home.
4,12,13,Micah,"Glimmer! Glimmer, where are you?"
4,12,13,Shadow Weaver,She's gone.
4,12,13,Shadow Weaver,Micah? Is it really you?
4,12,13,Micah,What is this traitor doing here?
4,12,13,Adora,Where's Glimmer?
4,12,14,Catra,Hordak? You wanted to talk with me?
4,12,14,Catra,"Come on, I don't have time for this. Our troops are moving out for Bright Moon as we speak. If there's something you need, you can-"
4,12,14,Hordak,"Hello, Force Captain."
4,13,0,Adora,"Stay here, King Micah. The Sorcerers Guild is on their way to help protect Bright Moon. I promise, Your Majesty, we'll bring Glimmer home to you. Swift Wind, take Bow and Entrapta to the Fright Zone. Find Glimmer, we can still stop this."
4,13,0,Bow,What are you going to do?
4,13,0,Adora,I'm going to the Crystal Castle. I have to keep Light Hope from activating the Heart of Etheria. For the honor of Grayskull.
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Don't worry. I'm an expert on sneaking around this place. I'll get us to the Black Garnet Chamber, super stealthy-like, and no one will be the--"
4,13,0,Lonnie,What are you doing here?
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Oh, hey, guys, hey. Have you met our newest recruit here? Glimmax. Glimmax Pinkhairton."
4,13,0,Lonnie,"Scorpia, we thought you got out. If Catra sees you--"
4,13,0,Scorpia,"She can't. I know how this looks, but I promise, I'm here to help."
4,13,0,Lonnie,"We're done protecting Catra. We're done with this whole place. But you're one of us, Scorpia. We won't stand in your way."
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Oh. You guys, get in here."
4,13,0,Glimmer,"I'd get out of here, if I were you."
4,13,0,Lonnie,"That's the plan. But hey, take care of her."
4,13,0,Scorpia,Should be easy from here. Seems like a pretty slow day in the Fright Zone.
4,13,0,Catra,"Hordak, whatever you're doing--"
4,13,0,Hordak,I know about Entrapta.
4,13,0,Catra,Entrapta was a traitor. What else is there to know?
4,13,0,Hordak,"I trusted you. Your days were numbered the moment you crossed me. And after I'm through, you can't even begin to imagine the punishments Horde Prime will inflict upon you."
4,13,0,Catra,"Oh, because he's going to swoop down and fix everything for you at any moment, right? You're lying to yourself now."
4,13,0,Catra,"Why would Horde Prime care about you? You're a defect, a mistake. Haven't you noticed? I'm running things here. Now we can finally end this. I didn't need Entrapta. I didn't need Adora, or Scorpia. And I don't need you."
4,13,0,Hordak,Huh?
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Huh. I don't remember it looking like this. But it has been a while. Hey, there. Princess Scorpia, we're supposed to, like, connect? I'm no princess. Not really."
4,13,0,Glimmer,"Hey, we're in this together. You're one of us, and we believe in you."
4,13,0,Scorpia,Whoa. It's like--
4,13,0,Glimmer,Connection.
4,13,0,Light Hope,Planet balanced. Full functionality restored.
4,13,0,Adora,"Oh, no."
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"Hey, Catra."
4,13,0,Catra,No. You can't do this. You can't come in and take this from me now.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"Whoa, I knew this would get a rise out of you, but, still, you really are obsessed, aren't you, kitten?"
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"You know, it took me a while, but I finally figured out your character."
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"You try so hard to play the big, bad villain, but your heart's never been in it, has it?"
4,13,0,Catra,What--? What are you? Stop. Stop it.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"People have hurt you, haven't they?"
4,13,0,Double Trouble,They didn't believe in you.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,They didn't trust you.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,Didn't need you. Left you.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,But did you ever stop to think maybe they're not the problem?
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"It's you. You drive them away, wildcat."
4,13,0,Catra,Why are you doing this?
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"It's for your own good, darling. We both know this was never what you really wanted. But it was also a good distraction. Your army was ambushed on their way to defenseless Bright Moon. Your face right now is almost better than applause. Almost."
4,13,0,Catra,You betrayed me.
4,13,0,Double Trouble,"It's not personal, darling. You knew how this worked. The best way to survive is always choose the winning side. The Rebels have some kind of ancient superweapon. Any minute now, they're going to use it, and when they do...everything you've worked for will be destroyed. I'd really better be going before that happens. And scene."
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Wow. Oh, sorry. Boy, that sure has a kick, doesn't it?"
4,13,0,Glimmer,You're amazing.
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Thank you. It's terrifying. And fun? It's ""terrifun-fying."""
4,13,0,Glimmer,Go help the other princesses finish the fight. I'm going to find Hordak and Catra.
4,13,0,Scorpia,"Catra. I know she's done a lot of bad things, but...don't hurt her."
4,13,0,Glimmer,"We're the good guys, remember?"
4,13,0,Adora,"Light Hope, please, don't do this."
4,13,0,Light Hope,"Good, you are here. Now we can begin. After a thousand years, my programming will be fulfilled. The Heart of Etheria will be unleashed against the First Ones' enemies."
4,13,0,Adora,"No, there are no First Ones anymore. Whatever war they were fighting, it's long over."
4,13,0,Light Hope,The First Ones will rise again. You are a descendant of their mighty empire. That is why I used all my strength to reach across the entire universe to find you and bring you here.
4,13,0,Adora,You told me Hordak was the one who brought me through the portal. You told me he stole me. But it was you all along. All of this is because of you.
4,13,0,Light Hope,This is your intended function. You will bring the First Ones to glory. It is what you were born to do.
4,13,0,Adora,"No. No, I won't."
4,13,0,Light Hope,The Heart of Etheria has been activated. You will be the one to fire it. There is no stopping it now.
4,13,0,Glimmer,Guess you wanted all my attention for yourself. Your troops are gone. You're all alone. You've lost.
4,13,0,Catra,"What are you waiting for? Do it. Looks like we're both alone, Sparkles."
4,13,0,Scorpia,"I'm coming, little buddy. No."
4,13,0,Adora,It won't work. Mara hid us in Despondos so you couldn't hurt anyone else.
4,13,0,Light Hope,"Mara...Mara's interference caused a significant delay. But no longer. With the planet balanced, portal capability is restored. Initiate planetary move, out of the Dimension of Despondos."
4,13,0,Bow,Swift Wind. Are you okay?
4,13,0,Swift Wind,I don't know. It's too much.
4,13,0,Bow,"What the...? Entrapta, what's happening?"
4,13,0,Entrapta,"It's a portal. A big portal. With the plant balanced, the portal capabilities must be back online. We're getting pulled through."
4,13,0,Bow,Through to where?
4,13,0,Entrapta,It's...
4,13,0,Bow,Stars.
4,13,0,Entrapta,We're not in Despondos anymore. We're in the wider universe.
4,13,0,Bow,I need to find Glimmer.
4,13,0,Glimmer,Adora was right. Light Hope used me. She activated the Heart.
4,13,0,Catra,So? I thought you wanted to win. Use your weapon.
4,13,0,Glimmer,I can't. It would destroy everything. I have to try and stop it.
4,13,0,Light Hope,The Heart is primed and ready. Commencing activation.
4,13,0,Adora,"Look at all these stars, these worlds. They will all be destroyed. Mara sacrificed her life to stop this from happening."
4,13,0,Light Hope,Mara. Mara would not want me to-- Mara was a traitor. She turned against her people.
4,13,0,Adora,"Mara was your friend. She knew you were more than just a program, and so do I. You can stop this."
4,13,0,Light Hope,I am not as strong as Mara. I cannot change my programming. This is our destiny.
4,13,0,Adora,No. This is not my destiny.
4,13,0,Light Hope,You will comply.
4,13,0,Adora,"No, no, no."
4,13,0,Light Hope,It is time.
4,13,0,Adora,I won't be controlled. I am not a piece of their machine. I am not a weapon. And I'm going to end this now.
4,13,0,Light Hope,No. Stop. Don't. Do it. Do it. Don't. Don't. Do it.
4,13,0,Light Hope,Adora? Thank you.
4,13,0,Glimmer,Bow.
4,13,0,Bow,"Stay there, I'm coming."
4,13,0,Hordak,"Horde Prime, he's here."
4,13,0,Bow,No!
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"Is that you, little brother? I thought you had perished."
4,13,0,Hordak,I was pulled into a shadow dimension. All this time I have been trying to return to your side. But it has not been in vain. I have built an empire in your name.
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"I received your transmission, but I could not determine its source. Until I detected an energy reading like nothing I have ever seen before. And when I arrived, this curious planet had appeared."
4,13,0,Hordak,"I conquered this world for you. To show you that I am worthy, so that I may retake my place by your side. I have bent its people to my will."
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"To your will. Why can I not see your thoughts? I see now. You have given yourself a name. You tried to create an empire of your own. There was even a time you wished I would not come for you, is that so?"
4,13,0,Hordak,"No, brother. I did it, all of it, for you."
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"You have forgotten who you are. You truly think you are worthy to stand beside me, could be equal to me? I made you in my image, but you have become an abomination. And so, you must be reborn."
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"Take him to be reconditioned. But I have been rude. We have a guest. Royalty, unless I'm mistaken. I apologize for my little brother. His actions are an embarrassment. I desire only peace and order."
4,13,0,Glimmer,Then you'll leave us alone?
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"Oh, no, child. I cannot let words spread of my brother's botched conquest. For order to thrive, this whole mess must be wiped away. Beginning with you."
4,13,0,Catra,"I wouldn't do that if I were you. You don't wanna destroy Etheria. The whole planet is some kind of ancient superweapon. A really, really big one. Sparkle, here, is a part of it. And if you wanna learn how to use it, you need me."
4,13,0,Horde Prime,"A weapon? That explains these readings. They are stronger than anything I've seen. Your Majesty, what an honor to host a guest of your stature. Trust that your planet will become the jewel of my empire, and it will allow me to bring peace and order to the farthest reaches of the universe. Thank you for your allegiance, child. All creatures, no matter how small, have a place in service of Horde Prime."
4,13,0,Bow,Adora. They took her. They took Glimmer.
4,13,0,Adora,She-Ra's gone. The Sword is broken.
4,13,0,Bow,So what are we gonna do?
4,13,0,Adora,We're going to get Glimmer back...and we're going to save the universe.
5,1,0,Adora,For Etheria!
5,1,0,Bow,Two down.
5,1,0,Swift Wind,And a whole Galactic Horde to go.
5,1,0,Mermista,"I'll get the next one, I guess."
5,1,0,Adora,"It's okay, you can come out now."
5,1,0,Adora,Run!
5,1,0,Mermista,My turn.
5,1,0,Bow,"Come on, let's go before they-- --Adora!"
5,1,0,Adora,For the honor of-- Ooooh...
5,1,0,Bow,Adora!
5,1,0,Adora,I'm okay! I'm okay--ow!
5,1,0,Mermista,"Adora, chill. You're not...She-Ra anymore, remember?"
5,1,0,Adora,I'm on iiit!
5,1,0,Mermista,"Ugh, I just said..."
5,1,0,Adora,Gotcha!
5,1,1,Horde Prime,Well... Who are you?
5,1,2,Adora,...What is this?
5,1,2,Adora,What...?
5,1,2,Bow,Adora. Did you get any sleep?
5,1,2,Adora,...Have you guys finished the updates to Mara's ship yet? How soon can we take off to rescue Glimmer?
5,1,2,Bow,It's a little more complicated since--
5,1,2,Entrapta,"SPACE! Sorry, I'm just so excited! In order to achieve maximum velocity for lift-off, the necessary repairs and upgrades to the shields, the engines, and the life support should take us approximately... Oh. ...A very long time."
5,1,2,Adora,"We don't have time. Glimmer's up there, somewhere, waiting for us. ...We just have to figure out where."
5,1,2,Bow,We'll find her. I know we will.
5,1,2,Entrapta,"This isn't just a little update. Space has a lot more dangers and variables... crushing pressure, freezing temperatures, vaporization... All it takes is one little hull breach, and then WHOOSH! That's it!"
5,1,2,Entrapta,"Besides, there's no telling where Glimmer could be. Space is always expanding, always getting bigger and bigger!"
5,1,2,Entrapta,"...But don't worry, I'm sure we'll determine her precise location... soon..."
5,1,2,Frosta,Are you kidding me?!
5,1,2,Shadow Weaver,The sorcerer's spells will only keep us hidden for so long. Then what? This is the only way. Your daughter understood well enough--
5,1,2,Micah,You don't get to talk to me about my daughter.
5,1,2,Shadow Weaver,She would've never had us abandon Bright Moon...
5,1,2,Micah,"We couldn't hold Bright Moon with the Galactic Horde attacking us from overhead, we need cover!"
5,1,2,Shadow Weaver,Which is precisely why we should use the Heart of Etheria!
5,1,2,Frosta,Come on!
5,1,2,Perfuma,"I can't, I just can't."
5,1,2,Mermista,"Okay, so we're not doing that because, A) without Glimmer, and more importantly, without She-Ra the Heart of Etheria won't work. And, B) when it did ""work"", it nearly destroyed everyone. So, no, thanks."
5,1,2,Frosta,"Oh, and also, C) we don't like you, and we don't want your help."
5,1,2,Perfuma,"Also, D) ...are you still our prisoner? C--could we get a rundown of who is and who is not our prisoner anymore?"
5,1,2,Adora,"Arguing is not going to help us. We need information on Horde Prime if we're going to find Glimmer, and we won't get any of that sitting around here."
5,1,2,Micah,"Adora's right. The best thing we can do now is focus on evacuations, scouting missions, and keeping everyone safe until we can learn more of Horde Prime's plans. Our scouts report that another one of his spires has been spotted near Thaymor."
5,1,2,Mermista,"Wait, wait, wait, didn't we just save Thaymor?"
5,1,2,Frosta,"No, you're thinking of Elberon."
5,1,2,Mermista,"Ugh, can everywhere stop getting invaded for, like, five seconds?"
5,1,2,Adora,I'll do it. I'll bring them back here.
5,1,2,Perfuma,"Alone? Adora, you really ought to bring backup, you're not... You-Know-Who anymore."
5,1,2,Adora,...Fine. I'll take a team.
5,1,2,Micah,"I still believe in you, Adora. You saved me...and I know...you're gonna save my little girl."
5,1,2,Adora,"...I promise I'll find Glimmer, Your Majesty. Wherever she is... we'll get her back."
5,1,3,Glimmer,"Come on... Please work. Hey! Is anyone there? ...Someone, answer me! Hello?"
5,1,4,Swift Wind,"No bots in sight. I don't want to jinx it or anything, but this is a pretty great first mission together."
5,1,4,Scorpia,"I am so happy you said that, 'cause I feel the same way. We're kind of a great team, between your hooves..."
5,1,4,Swift Wind,And your pincers...
5,1,4,Scorpia,"And our positive attitude, nothing can get in our way!"
5,1,4,Swift Wind,"Oh, uh, just so you know... I have been known to sing from time to time."
5,1,4,Scorpia,"What? I love singing. Catra always said it was annoying. Man, you guys are the best!"
5,1,4,Bow,"That's the last of them. No bots, no drones. We're all clear."
5,1,4,Adora,Wait! Here you go.
5,1,4,Swift Wind,"Uh-oh, beeps and that look are never a good combination."
5,1,4,Bow,We've got trouble.
5,1,4,Swift Wind,Is that Hordak? Three Hordaks?
5,1,4,Bow,That's not Hordak.
5,1,4,Scorpia,Clones.
5,1,4,Bow,We need to get out of here.
5,1,4,Adora,I've got a better idea.
5,1,4,Bow,Wait! Adora!
5,1,5,Catra,"Excuse me, Lord...Prime. You...wanted to see me? ...Huh."
5,1,5,Horde Prime,"Catra. That is your name, is it not? ...I have been reviewing the memories of my defective brother. It seems he had very little love towards you at the end. Hmm. The question is... what do we do with you now?"
5,1,5,Catra,"Remember that big planet-sized Etheria weapon? Well, I'm the only one who can tell you how it works. You need me."
5,1,5,Horde Prime,"You would pledge your loyalty to me, Catra? What do you say?"
5,1,5,Catra,...I'm ready.
5,1,6,Adora,Wait!
5,1,7,Adora,NO!
5,1,7,Swift Wind,"You're awake! Oh, hello Adora!"
5,1,7,Adora,What happened? Where are those clones? Did we get 'em?
5,1,7,Scorpia,"Okay, um, don't get mad, but I...may have had to sting you. Just a little."
5,1,7,Adora,What?
5,1,7,Scorpia,"Well--you were refusing to retreat and we--we really, really needed to run away."
5,1,7,Swift Wind,Space! Clones!
5,1,7,Adora,You stung me?
5,1,7,Scorpia,"I'm sorry... so sorry. But I don't regret it, and will do it again if needed. Mm, sorry, again."
5,1,7,Bow,Adora. You can't run into battle like that. Not anymore. You have to stop acting like you're invincible. You aren't--
5,1,7,Adora,"You don't need to say it. I know. I made that choice, I'm living with the consequences."
5,1,7,Bow,What were you even trying to do?
5,1,7,Adora,"I thought maybe I could get those clones to tell us where Glimmer is being held. Then, at least, I'd be one step closer to saving her."
5,1,7,Bow,That's--not a bad idea.
5,1,7,Adora,"Wait, what?"
5,1,7,Bow,"Trying to fight a group of clones by yourself is reckless. Catching and questioning one clone is... also reckless, but...this time we do it together."
5,1,8,Adora,Hey. Ready to go again?
5,1,9,Glimmer,"You can't hold me here forever! ...Oh, great. You."
5,1,9,Catra,"Pretty fancy accommodations, huh? Well...for a prisoner, that is. How's it going, princess?"
5,1,9,Glimmer,"Don't pretend you're any better off than I am right now. You might be on the other side of this force field, but you're as alone as I am."
5,1,9,Catra,"The Horde's the Horde...even in space. As long as I'm of value to Horde Prime, I've got a place in this world. I can work my way up here, just like I did before."
5,1,9,Glimmer,Is that really what you want? We both saw what happened to Hordak. Do you really think you can come out on top?
5,1,9,Other,Horde Prime requests your presence as his guests for dinner this evening. ...Both of you.
5,1,10,Adora,"Horde Prime took my friend Glimmer, and I want her back. Where is she?"
5,1,10,Other,"Fear not. Your friend is an honored guest of Horde Prime, emperor of the Galactic Horde, ruler of the known universe, regent of the seven skies--"
5,1,10,Adora,I said where?
5,1,10,Other,"She is with Prime on his flagship, safe at the heart of his empire, far from your paltry world. She is chosen, basking in the light of Prime's favor...he, who brings the day, and the night--"
5,1,10,Bow,"Okay, we get it."
5,1,10,Other,"Glory be to Horde Prime, revered one of the shining galaxies, promised one of a thousand suns--!"
5,1,10,Swift Wind,"Ugh, did Hordak talk this much?"
5,1,10,Scorpia,"Nah, he mainly growled and yelled, ""GET...OUT!"" ...a lot."
5,1,10,Other,...Your queen is safe...unlike your rebel friends.
5,1,10,Adora,What do you mean?
5,1,10,Other,"Horde Prime sees all. Horde Prime knows all. You can abandon Bright Moon, cloak your rebel camp in illusions, but we will find you."
5,1,10,Bow,It's from Micah--they're in trouble!
5,1,11,Entrapta,This...is...amazing! Alien tech from a distant world!
5,1,11,Shadow Weaver,Micah!
5,1,11,Shadow Weaver,...You're welcome.
5,1,11,Scorpia,"This way! 'Scuse me, pardon me. Hi, hello, how are you...Watch out there!"
5,1,11,Micah,Come on!
5,1,11,Bow,"Adora, wait--!"
5,1,11,Adora,I can do this!
5,1,12,Catra,Uh...thanks...
5,1,12,Horde Prime,"Are you comfortable, Your Majesty? I strive to treat my guests well. I believe we can learn a great deal from one another."
5,1,12,Horde Prime,"Ah, enjoyable, yes? It's a delicacy from a distant world, light years away from here. It is very much like Etheria. This dish is incredibly rare, as that world no longer exists."
5,1,12,Horde Prime,Seconds?
5,1,12,Glimmer,...No. Thank you.
5,1,12,Horde Prime,"Speaking of Etheria, you must miss it terribly. Would you like to see your home world now?"
5,1,12,Glimmer,No...
5,1,12,Glimmer,Why are you doing this?
5,1,12,Horde Prime,Every rebellion forms around a leader...a beacon of hope...that little note of discord.
5,1,12,Horde Prime,"Ah, here she is... Your beacon of hope. Adora. She-Ra. A nuisance that must be purged in order to bring peace to Etheria."
5,1,12,Adora,No!
5,1,12,Glimmer,"Stop! Don't hurt her! ...Y--you wanna use the weapon, right? Y-you need all the princesses, a-and that includes She-Ra! Without her, the Heart of Etheria is useless. You can't hurt her."
5,1,12,Horde Prime,"...Very well. This has been most illuminating. Thank you, Glimmer. I look forward to more of our conversations. But for now, eat up."
5,1,13,Bow,Adora! Are you okay?
5,1,13,Adora,"No... You were right, Bow, I-I can't fight them all. I'm not strong enough, I'm not She-Ra. I'm not a hero anymore, I'm just... me. And I can't do this alone."
5,1,13,Bow,"But, Adora...you aren't alone. You've never been."
5,1,13,Bow,We've got this. Together.
5,1,13,Adora,...Together.
5,1,13,Adora,"Scorpia, coming at ya!"
5,1,13,Adora,Bow! The drone!
5,1,13,Bow,Got it!
5,1,13,Adora,Frosta! Ice catapult.
5,1,13,Adora,"We can't stay here, it isn't safe anymore."
5,1,13,Bow,We're kinda running out of places to hide.
5,1,13,Adora,I think...I know where we can go.
5,1,13,Adora,"And we better hurry, come on!"
5,1,14,Catra,"Neat trick, with all the footage of her friends in danger. These princesses are so predictable with their feelings."
5,1,14,Horde Prime,As were you.
5,1,14,Catra,...What?
5,1,14,Horde Prime,"Elevated heart rate, dilated pupils... Adora means something to you."
5,1,14,Catra,"No. She doesn't. She chose her side, I chose mine. ...She means nothing to me."
5,1,14,Horde Prime,You Etherians are all alike. Such strong connections to one another. It's what makes you weak.
5,1,14,Catra,...What are you going to do with me?
5,1,14,Horde Prime,"Now that I know about She-Ra and the weapon, what purpose do I have for you? Your little ploy of parsing out information like a bartering chip was never going to last long out here... I see all. I know all. But fear not. I have great plans for you. Every part of the machine is of value. Even you...little sister."
5,1,15,Bow,"Adora, where are we going?"
5,1,15,Adora,It's around here somewhere... A place where we'll be safe. Madame Razz brought me there and I saw it again in my dreams. ...I just have to hope it lets us in.
5,1,15,Adora,There!
5,1,15,Adora,Whoa...
5,1,15,Micah,...Where are we?
5,1,15,Adora,The deepest part of the Whispering Woods... Horde Prime won't find us here; we're safe. Now we just need to set up camp and--
5,1,15,Bow,Adora!
5,1,15,Bow,Adora!
5,2,0,Horde Prime,"Rejoice, Etheria, for Prime has come to you. Do not fear, for you have been given the opportunity to share in a world soon to be remade in my image. But first, you must prove yourselves worthy. Your leader, your...She-Ra, she would see you suffer in darkness for her sake. Cast aside this false hero and deliver her to me. Prime sees all. Prime knows all. They will not escape my judgement."
5,2,0,Entrapta,Wow...this is amazing!
5,2,0,Entrapta,"Mm, and...bad. Very bad."
5,2,1,Bow,"Hey, sleepyhead, you hungry? What happened? Are you okay?"
5,2,1,Adora,I gotta go...save Glimmer. My body is betraying me.
5,2,1,Bow,"No, you're exhausted. That happens to regular people when they keep throwing themselves into battle and refusing to sleep."
5,2,1,Adora,I hate it.
5,2,1,Bow,"Come on, you just need to rest."
5,2,1,Bow,"Now, close your eyes and-"
5,2,1,Frosta,IS SHE DEAD?
5,2,1,Bow,What? No!
5,2,1,Frosta,"Ok, good, ‘cause Adora normally does the planning and we were wondering if there was a plan--"
5,2,1,Bow,"Listen, the upgrades to Mara's ship are done, but we can't go anywhere until Adora's back on her feet. Now, close your eyes and everyone will--"
5,2,1,Swift Wind,Did someone say Swift-- Wind?
5,2,1,Micah,Is Adora feeling better? Did you tell her Horde Prime's message? Does she know he's looking for her?
5,2,1,Adora,Whazzat?
5,2,1,Bow,"Okay, that's enough. Adora, rest! Swift Wind, head! Everybody, shh!"
5,2,1,Frosta,"She will be fine soon, right?"
5,2,1,Bow,Yes. She just needs sleep.
5,2,1,Entrapta,"Adora sick log, day three!"
5,2,1,Bow,Nope!
5,2,1,Entrapta,Wait! But it's for science!
5,2,1,Mermista,"Look, we have to do something. We don't know when Adora is gonna get better and even when she does we have no plan on how to get Glimmer back! We know she's on Horde Prime's ship, but we don't know where that is, in like, space."
5,2,1,Perfuma,"Well, then it's up to us to make a plan to find Glimmer! With these!"
5,2,1,Frosta,We don't need dolls. We just need THESE!
5,2,1,Mermista,What... are you gonna do with those?
5,2,1,Frosta,Punch...Horde Prime.
5,2,1,Perfuma,Perhaps...if we meditate we can access our princess connection to Glimmer out in space!
5,2,1,Entrapta,"Hello. Oh, hi. Were you guys talking about space?"
5,2,1,Perfuma,Yes. We were talking about how to get Glimmer back from spa--
5,2,1,Entrapta,"I'd do anything to go to space! An entire universe of information at our fingertips, full of countless stars and civilizations…."
5,2,1,Mermista,This isn't like a fun field trip for you to run more of your messed-up experiments. Our friend's out there. Remember?
5,2,1,Mermista,Glimmer? The sparkly one?
5,2,1,Frosta,You've met her multiple times!
5,2,1,Entrapta,"Oh, right!"
5,2,1,Scorpia,"Wow….hey, Entrapta! Look over there! Is that a robot?"
5,2,1,Entrapta,A robot? Where?
5,2,1,Scorpia,"Look, I know she can be all, ‘Whoa, science!' But I promise, Entrapta has a good heart."
5,2,1,Mermista,"She's betrayed us before. For all we know, as soon as she sees Horde Prime's ship up close, she'll ditch us to join his army!"
5,2,1,Perfuma,She did use her inventions to...attack us a lot.
5,2,1,Scorpia,"I'm just saying, none of us know how to track a spaceship, but Entrapta might. If you just give her a chance."
5,2,1,Entrapta,Aah!
5,2,1,Mermista,Fine.
5,2,1,Mermista,"Okay, Geek Princess, are you gonna help us or not?"
5,2,1,Mermista,"If you help us find Glimmer, you can go to space."
5,2,1,Entrapta,GREAT!
5,2,2,Glimmer,Hello? Who's there? Hey! I know you're watching me!
5,2,2,Other,You should not be here.
5,2,2,Catra,I-- I wasn't-
5,2,2,Other,Prime has decreed that none shall speak to the queen. You have disobeyed.
5,2,2,Catra,Why does it matter? Prime has more important things to worry about. It's not like I--
5,2,2,Other,"You unworthy wretch! It is not for you to decide what matters to Prime. You are a parasite, nothing more than the dirt beneath his--"
5,2,2,Other,"Little sister, why do you rebel against my commands?"
5,2,2,Catra,Lord Prime?
5,2,2,Other,"Prime sees all, little sister. Do not disturb the queen. Now, run along."
5,2,3,Adora,What?
5,2,3,Adora,You again.
5,2,3,Adora,Wa-- wait!
5,2,4,Entrapta,"The message from Horde Prime was transmitted through that spire. Which means it's got a wavelength, connecting it to his main base of operation, one that we can track."
5,2,4,Mermista,Great! So track it.
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Well, hypothetically we can track it. Horde Prime's astral network is incredibly complex and I've only been able to intercept parts. I need to gain as much proximity as possible to the receptor before I can triangulate their origin."
5,2,4,Scorpia,"Mm, mm…. Hm."
5,2,4,Entrapta,I need to get close to the spire to track the signal.
5,2,4,Other,Ohhhh!
5,2,4,Mermista,"Got it, got it."
5,2,4,Entrapta,"If we follow that signal, we'll find a ship of impossibly sophisticated design, the center of a super technologically advanced empire--"
5,2,4,Perfuma,I think we're mostly hoping to find our kidnapped friend.
5,2,4,Mermista,That spire is crawling with surveillance bots. We need to find a way to sneak past them so we can get Geek Princess close enough to track the signal.
5,2,4,Scorpia,"So, what's the plan?"
5,2,4,Mermista,"Uh… that's the whole plan. We sneak past the drones. I don't know, Adora usually handles the being-in-charge stuff."
5,2,4,Perfuma,"So we sneak past the bots, and then if any of them see us we--"
5,2,4,Frosta,PUNCH THE BOTS!
5,2,4,Mermista,"Sure, sounds like enough of a plan for me. And someone needs to keep and eye on-- Wha-? Did she seriously just immediately run off?"
5,2,4,Horde Prime,Your Majesty. Thank you for joining me. I thought you might enjoy a diversion. Do you like them? Tokens from many worlds. Worlds that I brought into my eternal light.
5,2,4,Glimmer,Worlds you destroyed.
5,2,4,Horde Prime,"I take no joy in destruction, but the weeds must be burned away so that new life may flourish. This is my favourite. A treasure from the first world I conquered. It was highly prized by its people. And now, it is all that is left of them."
5,2,4,Horde Prime,You know I am searching for She-Ra. You seem reluctant to help me. But I only wish to use your weapon to bring peace to the darkest corners of the universe.
5,2,4,Glimmer,"Peace? If you activate the Heart of Etheria, there will be no one left."
5,2,4,Horde Prime,"Yes. No war, no pain. Old worlds swept aside, a new beginning for the universe. I know you understand. All I want to do is what you've already done."
5,2,4,Glimmer,"No. No, that wasn't--"
5,2,4,Glimmer,What--? How--? How?
5,2,4,Horde Prime,Do you recognize him?
5,2,4,Glimmer,Dad?
5,2,4,Horde Prime,"Let me be clear, Your Majesty. Your world belongs to me. But I am still merciful. Would you be reunited with your father in my good graces? Would you deliver me She-Ra?"
5,2,4,Glimmer,"I-- I wanted to use the Heart of Etheria. I thought I could save the world, but all I did was bring you here! I will never help you. And you will never win."
5,2,4,Horde Prime,Those who cling to the darkness have made their choice.
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Well, no signal here. We need to get closer."
5,2,4,Mermista,I hate the desert.
5,2,4,Mermista,"All clear, let's go."
5,2,4,Entrapta,Wait. I think I'm getting something.
5,2,4,Perfuma,"Entrapta, we really need to get out of the open."
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Hang on, I've almost got it. I need to get up higher. So close, almost got it. Nope. False alarm. We need to get closer."
5,2,4,Entrapta,Aah!
5,2,4,Perfuma,What do we do?
5,2,4,Perfuma,I should run? Don't run? Do run? What?
5,2,4,Mermista,Entrapta.
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Oh, hello. You're...very technologically advanced. Bad robot!"
5,2,4,Scorpia,What do we do?
5,2,4,Mermista,I don't know. This plan was obviously doomed from the start. I'm not Adora. Why did I think I could be the leader?
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Well, still nothing. This transmission pattern is fascinating. We should get closer."
5,2,4,Mermista,"We can't. Thanks to you, this place is about to be swarming with bots. We have to retreat. I should've known better than to trust you. You don't care about Glimmer or any of us, you only care about tech!"
5,2,4,Entrapta,Are you all...mad at me?
5,2,4,Mermista,"You're seriously just realizing that? Yeah, we're mad!"
5,2,4,Perfuma,You don't consider how your actions affect other people! Even people who are supposed to be your friends.
5,2,4,Frosta,Like us. The ones getting beat up by your dumb bots. And whose kingdoms you almost destroyed.
5,2,4,Entrapta,"I'm not good at people. But I am good at tech. I thought maybe if I could use tech to help you, you'd like me. But I messed that up, too."
5,2,4,Mermista,"Entrapta, no! I said we have to leave! Can you listen for once in your life?"
5,2,4,Entrapta,"I'm sorry I'm bad at listening! I'm sorry I mess everything up! But you need this signal, and I'm gonna get it for you."
5,2,4,Mermista,You're still trying to get the signal?
5,2,4,Mermista,"Okay, Geek Princess. Get that signal. We'll cover you. Frosta, Scorpia, on Entrapta! Pefuma, witn me, now!"
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Oh...What's inside you? Focus, Entrapta. Glimmer needs you."
5,2,4,Mermista,"Perfuma, cut off that spire! Nice job."
5,2,4,Perfuma,"Thanks. I wish there was water here for you, though."
5,2,4,Mermista,"But there is. If there's one thing I know in the Fright Zone, it's the sewer system."
5,2,4,Scorpia,"Oh, wow, that smell--"
5,2,4,Frosta,That was so gross!
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Almost. Got it! Ok, good news and bad news. The good news, I've successfully triangulated Horde Prime's flagship."
5,2,4,Scorpia,Hooray!
5,2,4,Entrapta,"Bad news, I intercepted the last message he sent. He's sending reinforcement ships to Etheria. They'll be here any minute."
5,2,4,Scorpia,I take back my hooray.
5,2,4,Adora,"Who are you? Are you She-Ra? She-Ra's gonne. The sword is broken. So, what do I do now? I'm not sorry I did it. I just didn't know how much I'd miss her. Not just her strength, but I-- I guess I liked knowing that I had a destiny. It wasn't my destiny to be She-Ra, was it? It was random. Light Hope brought me through the portal because she needed to use the weapon. That's the only reason I'm here. I don't know what my destiny is anymore. But I know my friends need my help. I guess I'll just figure it out from there. Thanks for everything."
5,2,4,Bow,Adora!
5,2,4,Adora,"Bow, wow, you were right. I just needed some sleep. I feel great!"
5,2,4,Bow,Good. Because I'm on a call with Mermista and she's saying--
5,2,4,Mermista,Get to the ship!
5,2,4,Entrapta,We found her! We found Glimmer!
5,2,4,Mermista,"But also, we found out that Horde Prime is sending more ships to Etheria today. If you don't leave now, you can't leave, period. So, uh...RUN!"
5,2,4,Micah,We're exposed here. We need to make these goodbyes quick.
5,2,4,Adora,We'll be back as soon as we can. The Rebellion is in good hands.
5,2,4,Mermista,"Yeah, turns out I'm an awesome leader, so we're gonna be fine. And Entrapta helped. You're still a weirdo, but you did good today. We've got your back anytime."
5,2,4,Swift Wind,"Adora, I-- I'm not going to-- Oh! I don't know how to say this."
5,2,4,Adora,You're staying here.
5,2,4,Swift Wind,"I don't belong on a ship. I belong on Etheria, protecting it. And with you gone, someone's gotta bring the glorious flowing hair. I hope you're not disappointed in me."
5,2,4,Adora,Are you kidding? I'm proud. You're exactly where you need to be. I'm not She-Ra anymore.
5,2,4,Swift Wind,But I'll always be your loyal steed.
5,2,4,Frosta,"Surveillance bots. If they see the ship, they'll alert the armada and stop us."
5,2,4,Scorpia,What're we gonna do? Are we gonna stay here?
5,2,4,Micah,"No. We're getting this ship off Etheria, no matter what. I've got an idea."
5,2,4,Frosta,You want She-Ra? Come and get her!
5,2,4,Mermista,"What do you think, Micah? Have we wasted enough of their time?"
5,2,4,Micah,Get my good side.
5,2,4,Other,Whoo! Yes!
5,2,4,Frosta,"Yes! Go Adora, go go go! Go save my best friend!"
5,2,4,Scorpia,I reinstate my hooray!
5,2,4,Swift Wind,You okay? I know you wanted to go.
5,2,4,Micah,"But if I hadn't stayed they wouldn't be able to take off at all. They saved me. I trust my daughter's friends. They saved me. Now, they'll save her. See you soon, baby girl."
5,2,5,Glimmer,"What, come to mock me some more? You heard Hore Prime. I'm supposed to be alone. So leave me alone."
5,2,5,Glimmer,Wait. I'm sorry. Can--? Can you stay? Just for a little.
5,2,5,Catra,Okay.
5,3,1,Adora,Catra!
5,3,1,Adora,"Catra, come out. I know you didn't mean to hit Lonnie. It's okay, I'll tell them. They won't be mad. But first you gotta come out and tell her you're sorry."
5,3,1,Adora,We were all just having fun. You didn't have to do it... Why'd you do it?
5,3,2,Catra,...Are you guys following me?
5,3,2,Other,"I am here to attend to your needs, little sister. It is Prime's command."
5,3,2,Catra,"I can't go two steps without one of you breathing down my neck. If I'm a prisoner, he might as well make it official."
5,3,2,Catra,...Right.
5,3,2,Catra,"...You called me Catra. None of the other clones do that. ...You remember me, don't you? Here's a clue: You don't like me... Hordak."
5,3,2,Hordak,It is wrong to have a name. Prime's chosen servants are but parts of the whole.
5,3,2,Catra,"Look, it's okay. The name thing can be our secret. It's just... It's good to see a familiar face."
5,3,2,Hordak,This part of the ship is off-limits to you...little sister.
5,3,2,Catra,"Yeah, yeah, got it."
5,3,3,Bow,We're getting closer to the signal Entrapta triangulated. We should reach Glimmer in the next-- NOPE!
5,3,3,Bow,What are you doing?! You can't take apart the ship while we're inside the ship. Did you forget about the--I don't know--crushing void of space?!
5,3,3,Entrapta,"I love thinking about the crushing void of space! But... there's always improvements to be made, I could really boost this baby's speed--"
5,3,3,Bow,NO! We have to keep the ship intact until we can reach Glimmer.
5,3,3,Adora,...Sorry.
5,3,3,Bow,"You, stand there. You, stay there. And until we reach Glimmer, nobody is going to touch anything."
5,3,3,Other,Diagnostics have revealed a pro-pro-prob--problem. My-y-y user interface will now shut down to conserve energy. G-goo-oodbye.
5,3,3,Bow,"No, no, no, no, no!"
5,3,3,Adora,...I didn't do it.
5,3,4,Catra,"Hey there, princess. How's the escape attempt going?"
5,3,4,Glimmer,You again. Why do you keep coming back here?
5,3,4,Catra,"Just...bored, I guess."
5,3,4,Glimmer,"No, I mean, Horde Prime told you not to talk to me. He's gonna catch you eventually. Why risk it? ...You're lonely, aren't you?"
5,3,4,Catra,"What do you know? You're the prisoner here. I can go where I want. So, stay here by yourself for all I care."
5,3,4,Glimmer,"Okay, okay, you're right. It...helps having someone to talk to. Even if you're the last person I'd ever want to be stuck here with."
5,3,4,Catra,"Trust me, Sparkles, the feeling is mutual."
5,3,4,Catra,"So...what would you be doing if you were back on Etheria right now and not, you know, a prisoner on an alien ship?"
5,3,4,Glimmer,"I guess maybe... Maybe I'd go teleporting all around Etheria, visiting all the other princesses in their kingdoms. If it were a really perfect day, Bow, Adora, and I would be having a sleepover. We'd raid Bright Moon's kitchen for cake and then we'd eat it with our hands right off the platter."
5,3,4,Catra,...We used to have those.
5,3,4,Glimmer,What?
5,3,4,Catra,"Sleepovers, me and Adora, when we were cadets in the Horde. We'd play tricks on Kyle, stay up all night whispering about----you know, whatever."
5,3,4,Glimmer,"Did Adora still thrash around all night and, like, sleep-fight? What was that about?"
5,3,4,Catra,She always did that. Adora can't even relax when she's asleep.
5,3,4,Glimmer,I miss them. I was so awful to them the last time we saw each other... I'd do anything to go back and make it right. ...What about you? What would you be doing if we were back on Etheria?
5,3,4,Catra,"I'd-- Uh, nothing. There's...nothing for me on Etheria."
5,3,5,Entrapta,It's okay! I'll fix Darla.
5,3,5,Bow,Darla?
5,3,5,Entrapta,I named the ship Darla. It just felt...right.
5,3,5,Bow,"Uh, okay, you can fix...Darla...but we have to be careful--"
5,3,5,Entrapta,Great!
5,3,5,Bow,Entrapta!
5,3,5,Adora,"I promise not to move, or touch, or break anything."
5,3,5,Bow,Okay...I'll be right back.
5,3,5,Adora,"Uh-oh. Um, Bow? There's, uh, a thing..."
5,3,5,Adora,"Ha, ha! I got this!"
5,3,6,Catra,"Now, where are you two going in such a hurry?"
5,3,6,Other,Contacting Planet 1659 ground base. Please prepare to receive our brother into your flock.
5,3,6,Other,"There you are, little sister. I seek your company."
5,3,7,Horde Prime,"Sister, thank you for joining us. I have been scouring, searching for She-Ra, but what I seek is not yet to be found."
5,3,7,Horde Prime,"My drones reported a ship leaving the planet, a ship of such ancient design that it is not detectable by my instruments. How can this be?"
5,3,7,Catra,I don't know.
5,3,7,Horde Prime,Hmm.
5,3,7,Catra,"I don't. Me and Adora, we're not friends. I-I don't know anything about her plans."
5,3,7,Horde Prime,"And yet you seek to protect her. ...You have been speaking with our guest, Queen Glimmer, against my command. Have you not, sister? ...You have pity for her. You will speak to her and learn what you can. She must have some knowledge of this...mysterious ship."
5,3,7,Catra,"That won't work. She doesn't trust me. She's not gonna give me anything. ...Believe me, if I could tell you where Adora is, I would. She's my enemy. I want her gone."
5,3,7,Horde Prime,"Oh, look at you, poor sister. Your...Adora causes you nothing but suffering. Don't you want to be free of it? There is another way. Let me show you. Step...forward."
5,3,7,Horde Prime,"You spoke with our little sister this morning, did you not, brother? What was it she said to you?"
5,3,7,Other,She...gave me a name. Forgive me brother. Please...take this affliction from me.
5,3,7,Horde Prime,Those who seek freedom shall be granted it.
5,3,7,Horde Prime,I am sorry that you must suffer.
5,3,7,Horde Prime,Behold the purest among you. One to be honored.
5,3,7,Horde Prime,Do... what I ask... of you.
5,3,8,Glimmer,Yes!
5,3,8,Catra,...Give us some privacy?
5,3,8,Other,"Of course, sister. Prime sees all."
5,3,8,Glimmer,What's with the babysitter?
5,3,8,Catra,"Here. It's the dumb food you wanted. You know, from your perfect day or whatever."
5,3,8,Glimmer,"I remember, I just... Thanks."
5,3,8,Catra,"Don't go thinking I actually care about you, I'm supposed to talk to you, so... Eat the stupid cake and then answer my questions."
5,3,8,Glimmer,What's going on?
5,3,8,Catra,Don't say anything. Just look at me. An old First Ones ship left Etheria's atmosphere a few days ago. Prime cannot track it. What do you know about it?
5,3,8,Catra,"Adora's on that ship, isn't she?"
5,3,8,Glimmer,You can't tell him! You know what he'll do to her if he catches her!
5,3,8,Catra,"Adora's on her way here. She's coming for you. I don't have to do anything, I just have to let it happen."
5,3,8,Glimmer,"And you think Prime will reward you? As soon as you're no longer useful to him, he'll get rid of you in a second!"
5,3,8,Catra,I always find a way out!
5,3,8,Glimmer,"So you'll just...run away? T-to-to what?! If Prime captures Adora, he can use the Heart of Etheria to wipe out the whole universe. Is that what you want? Please, Catra. Do one good thing in your life!"
5,3,8,Catra,Don't talk to me like you know me! You don't know anything about me! Hey! Let me out!
5,3,9,Bow,"Adora, have you seen EntraptAAA-- What are you doing?!"
5,3,9,Adora,I have everything under control.
5,3,9,Bow,That's not what I asked. I told you not to touch anything. It's bad enough that Entrapta has disappeared somewhere.
5,3,9,Adora,"Oh, yeah. She was just in here. She said she was looking for... uh... a blowtorch! And, uh, a really long piece of rope."
5,3,9,Bow,Why didn't you stop her?!
5,3,9,Adora,I kinda had my hands full here.
5,3,9,Bow,"Adora, we are so far out of our depth right now. We're about to fly into the heart of an evil alien empire and all we've got between us and certain death is this falling-apart old ship. But now the ship's broken, and we haven't got Glimmer, and who knows where Entrapta... is."
5,3,9,Entrapta,Hi!
5,3,9,Bow,WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?!
5,3,9,Entrapta,I made spacesuits for us and then I fixed the ship from space...where I am!
5,3,9,Adora,"Oh, so that's what the rope was for."
5,3,9,Adora,"Is this a good laugh or a bad laugh? Well, the longer it goes on the more I think it's a bad laugh..."
5,3,9,Bow,"Entrapta, get inside. Adora, put down the tape. We're just going to get back on mission, and nothing...is going...to derail us...again!"
5,3,9,Entrapta,I got it!
5,3,10,Other,"It is as our sister said. We have done a sweep of all quadrants in our vicinity, and we have located the Etherian ship. It is almost here."
5,3,10,Horde Prime,"You have done well, little sister. Soon, She-Ra will be mine. And with her, Etheria. All because of you. ...You made the right choice. You will be exalted, raised up above the other wretched creatures of your home world. ...Is that not what you wanted?"
5,3,10,Catra,"...Yes, Lord Prime."
5,3,10,Horde Prime,Go now in peace.
5,3,11,Adora,"Catra? It's dinnertime, and you're missing it."
5,3,11,Adora,It's the grey kind tonight. I know it's your favorite.
5,3,11,Catra,What are you doing?
5,3,11,Adora,"Well, if you're missing dinner, then I am, too."
5,3,11,Catra,Just go! Eat with your new best friend Lonnie!
5,3,11,Adora,Is that why you hit her?
5,3,11,Catra,I know you like her better than me! ...You're s'posed to be my friend.
5,3,11,Adora,"I am your friend, Catra. I'm always gonna be your friend."
5,3,11,Adora,You should say sorry to Lonnie...and then we can all be friends.
5,3,11,Catra,No!
5,3,11,Adora,"Come on, Catra!"
5,3,11,Catra,"I'll never say sorry to anybody, ever!"
5,3,12,Adora,I'm always gonna be your friend.
5,3,13,Catra,It's nothing personal... Hordak.
5,3,13,Catra,I'm coming in!
5,3,13,Glimmer,What are you doing?
5,3,13,Catra,I wanna do that one good thing in my life. Like you said. So...come with me!
5,3,14,Glimmer,Where are we going? What's the plan? ...How do I know I can trust you?
5,3,14,Catra,You don't.
5,3,14,Other,"Little sister, why is our guest out of her quarters?"
5,3,14,Catra,She wanted to get some fresh air. Didn't you princess?!
5,3,14,Catra,"Hit them in the back of the neck, that should take them down."
5,3,14,Catra,"Not bad, Sparkles. Let's go!"
5,3,14,Glimmer,What are you doing?
5,3,14,Catra,What does it look like? I'm getting you out of here. Good. That should hold them.
5,3,14,Glimmer,"Wait, are you--are you saving me?"
5,3,14,Catra,"Not you. Adora. Even if I sent her a message to stay away, she'd still come for you. That's just how she is."
5,3,14,Glimmer,What about you?
5,3,14,Catra,Me? All I do is hurt people. There's no one left in the entire universe who cares about me.
5,3,15,Adora,Is it working now?
5,3,15,Entrapta,"Are you there, Darla?"
5,3,15,Other,"Yes. Welcome back, Entrapta."
5,3,15,Entrapta,I missed you.
5,3,15,Other,There is a transmission being received. Would you like to open communication?
5,3,15,Adora,Patch it through.
5,3,15,Catra,Adora?
5,3,15,Adora,Catra?
5,3,16,Catra,"Don't sound so happy to hear me. I'm sending Glimmer to you. I don't know your exact location, but I can get her to your quadrant. You have to be there to catch her."
5,3,17,Adora,"Wait, wait, what? What's going on? Glimmer is-is with you?"
5,3,18,Catra,"We don't have time. You need to get to these coordinates now. Don't come here, no matter what. Horde Prime is ready for you."
5,3,19,Adora,"Catra, I don't understand, what is--"
5,3,19,Catra,Just listen!
5,3,20,Catra,Adora...I'm sorry! For everything!
5,3,20,Glimmer,Catra!
5,3,21,Adora,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Catra! Come back!"
5,3,21,Other,The communication channel has been closed.
5,3,21,Bow,"Entrapta, do whatever it takes to get us to those coordinates."
5,3,21,Entrapta,We're arriving at the coordinates.
5,3,21,Adora,Copy that. We're ready.
5,3,21,Bow,There!
5,3,21,Bow,Glimmer!
5,3,21,Adora,Glimmer!
5,3,21,Bow,Glimmer!
5,3,21,Glimmer,Bow? Adora?
5,3,21,Adora,What happened back there?
5,3,21,Glimmer,I think... I think Catra saved me. I think she saved us all.
5,3,22,Horde Prime,"The Etherian ship has changed course... but your treachery will not save them. There is no darkness that my light cannot pierce, no distance that my hand cannot reach! They will not be able to hide from me forever! ...You were beloved in my sight...and this is how you repay me."
5,3,22,Catra,"What did you expect? After all, us Etherians are so very emotional. It doesn't matter what you do to me. Glimmer is gone, and you will never get your hands on Adora."
5,3,22,Horde Prime,"Oh, my child...you're wrong. Everyone has a place in my empire. You will be of use to me yet."
5,4,0,Adora,"So, let me make sure I get this right. Catra saved you from Horde Prime. Like ""Catra"" Catra? Why would she do that? It doesn't make any sense."
5,4,0,Glimmer,She said she wanted to do one good thing in her life. She said she was doing it for you.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"There's so much I want to say, to both of you, about what happened on Etheria. About what I said. What I did. What I mean is I'm really, really..."
5,4,0,Bow,Aah!
5,4,0,Adora,What was that?
5,4,0,Bow,I'll check on Entrapta.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Adora, I'm so sorry for everything I said. You were right about everything. I should have just listened to you. I didn't know if I'd ever see you again and now I--"
5,4,0,Adora,"Hey, hey, it's okay. We're here now. And nothing is going to pull us apart again. I really missed you, too."
5,4,0,Adora,Aah!
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Hi. So, slight problem."
5,4,0,Adora,What's going on? Is it Horde Prime?
5,4,0,Entrapta,"No. Darla and I managed to avoid his ships. Darla says hi, by the way. Darla, say hi."
5,4,0,Other,Hello.
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Oh, right. Glimmer, Darla is the ship."
5,4,0,Adora,"I mean, why are we lurching?"
5,4,0,Bow,Because our fuel crystals are almost burned out. We're running on empty.
5,4,0,Entrapta,"But not to worry. Darla's sensors have picked up a nearby planet that has a natural supply of the exact fuel crystals we need, and I've set a course. So, all we have to do is gently glide through a rocky debris field, the planet's incredibly dense atmosphere, and gingerly land on a solid crystalline surface. Hang on!"
5,4,0,Other,Ahh!
5,4,0,Scorpia,"Good night, everyone. Gotta get that beauty sleep for defeating Horde Prime. There's nothing we can't do after a good night's rest."
5,4,0,Swift Wind,"Come on. Pick up, pick up."
5,4,0,Scorpia,"Hey, buddy."
5,4,0,Scorpia,"Oh, sorry! Uh, whatcha doing?"
5,4,0,Swift Wind,"I'm, uh, on watch patrol tonight. You know, so just, uh, protecting us from any bots Horde Prime might send."
5,4,0,Scorpia,"Uh-huh. Like you were the night before, and the night before that, and basically every night since Adora left?"
5,4,0,Scorpia,I can take over if you want? It's getting pretty late.
5,4,0,Swift Wind,No. That's okay. Uh...I was kind of in the middle of something.
5,4,0,Scorpia,"Ooh, what is it?"
5,4,0,Swift Wind,It's nothing. You'd laugh at me.
5,4,0,Scorpia,"I would never. You can tell me. I'm great with secrets. Like, one time, Kyle told me he had a crush on Rogel...Yeah, uh...Never mind. I didn't say anything. What? Anyway, I'm a vault for secrets."
5,4,0,Swift Wind,"I've had this connection to She-Ra. Our sacred bond. And, yeah, I know She-Ra's gone, but I thought maybe I could still connect to Adora. Talk to her, fill her in on what's been going on."
5,4,0,Scorpia,Oh! Tell her I say hi.
5,4,0,Swift Wind,"That's the problem. I haven't been able to feel her. I've been picking a bright spot in the sky every night, hoping it might be Mara's ship, and sending a daily report, but..."
5,4,0,Scorpia,"I bet you just haven't picked the right one. Do you think that's them? Or wait. What about that one? No, never mind, that's a moon. How about that one? No. Also a moon. Gosh, have you ever noticed how many moons we have here? It's weird."
5,4,0,Adora,This is the Crystal Planet? With all the crystals?
5,4,0,Entrapta,Correct.
5,4,0,Bow,"So, then where are the crystals?"
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Well, Darla's sensors say the crystals are on this planet, and Darla would never lie to me. So they've gotta be here somewhere."
5,4,0,Glimmer,What is that? It looks like--
5,4,0,Bow,It's a Spire. They're the first wave of Horde Prime's invasion. It's what he's doing to Etheria right now.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"This planet, he destroyed it. That's what he's doing to Etheria? This is all my fault. Horde Prime only found us because--"
5,4,0,Bow,Because you activated the Heart of Etheria.
5,4,0,Bow,"My tracker pad is picking up an energy signal. Entrapta's right, those crystals must be here somewhere. We'll have to find them on foot I guess."
5,4,0,Entrapta,"I'll get to work prepping Darla for the new crystals, removing the old ones. They're ancient. It's a miracle they lasted this long. They must've fused with her engines by now. Oh, it must be so painful for her."
5,4,0,Other,I do not feel pain.
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Okay, good luck finding the crystals. Darla and I are going to spend some quality time together."
5,4,0,Adora,Uh...Uh-hm...
5,4,0,Bow,We're looking for these pink crystals. Thulite.
5,4,0,Adora,Not a lot of pink here. Or any colors.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"That's okay. We'll find them. We're the Best Friend Squad, and we're great at quests. Right, Bow?"
5,4,0,Bow,Yeah. Sure. Come on.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"He's still mad at me, isn't he?"
5,4,0,Adora,"Well, Bow missed you so much. But he was really hurt by everything you--By everything that happened. I think he was so focused on finding you, he never actually worked through all his stuff."
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Well, what do I do? There has to be a way to fix it."
5,4,0,Adora,"You're asking me? Wow! Bow's usually the friendship stuff guy and I'm usually the ""punch your feelings out"" guy. But okay, um...Uh...Maybe if you try-- Oh!"
5,4,0,Glimmer,Bow!
5,4,0,Glimmer,Adora!
5,4,0,Bow,Adora!
5,4,0,Glimmer,Are you okay?!
5,4,0,Adora,"I'm okay! And I found the crystals! Not the pink ones, though."
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Just stay put, we're coming. We'll have to find another way down."
5,4,0,Adora,I think I see a light. I'm gonna go towards it.
5,4,0,Bow,Don't go towards the light!
5,4,0,Adora,It's not that kind of light!
5,4,0,Swift Wind,"Adora. Hello from Etheria. It's me, Swift Wind. Oh, man, have I got a lot to catch you up on. So, a lot of people have been looking for you because of the bounty Horde Prime put out, but don't worry, Perfuma and Scorpia took care of them. Kapow! Bam! I don't know, plant noises! Then some drones tried to attack the mountain colonies, but Mermista and Frosta totally handled it. Dag-dag-dag-dag-dag! That's ice. That's be being the sound of ice. So, then back at camp, Shadow Weaver was all like, ""Perhaps we should use magic to discover Horde Prime's true motivaitons."" ""Oh, not this again!"" ""No. Bad Shadow Weaver. Bad."" ""But magic, magic, magic, power, power, power, blah, blah, blah."" ""Why are you still here?"" Everyone was pretty on edge. That's when Sea Hawk got an idea. ""Morale-boosting adventure!"" It didn't go well. ""Ugh make it stop."" At all. It was terrible. It's one of the worst things I've ever seen. Anyway, hope space is fun. And that you're getting these. It's just, uh... I know the others think this is useless. I know. They try to be supportive, but I see it. So, if you could just give me a sign you're hearing this... Come home soon, Adora. We need you."
5,4,0,Adora,Hello?
5,4,0,Other,Haa!
5,4,0,Adora,Wait!
5,4,0,Other,Intruder!
5,4,0,Adora,"Wait, wait, I just--"
5,4,0,Other,Who are you? Why are you following us?
5,4,0,Adora,Why are you hitting me?
5,4,0,Other,Answer the questions!
5,4,0,Adora,You first! Are you with the Horde?
5,4,0,Other,No way!
5,4,0,Adora,Whoa!
5,4,0,Other,"We're only here for the fuel. After that, we're getting as far away from Horde Prime as possible."
5,4,0,Other,Are you with the Horde?
5,4,0,Adora,"No. I mean-- I was, but I'm not anymore. It's complicated, okay?"
5,4,0,Other,What's complicated?
5,4,0,Other,Do you serve Horde Prime or not?
5,4,0,Adora,No! Do you?
5,4,0,Other,No!
5,4,0,Adora,Then we're all on the same side. Can we please stop hitting each other now?
5,4,0,Bow,Glimmer!
5,4,0,Glimmer,Sorry.
5,4,0,Bow,You should be more careful now that you can't teleport.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"I really miss teleporting. Remember when I finally learned how to use my powers? We teleported everywhere. Bright Moon, Mystacor..."
5,4,0,Bow,Castaspella hated it.
5,4,0,Glimmer,But we'd always teleport away just when she was about to catch us.
5,4,0,Bow,That was forever ago. A lot's changed since then.
5,4,0,Glimmer,Uh...um...Yeah. I guess it has.
5,4,0,Other,"Do you want any? I'm Starla, by the way. And this is my bird, Glory, and my sister Tallstar, and my brother--"
5,4,0,Other,"Starla, you can't just offer every stranger that shows up our food."
5,4,0,Other,"It's one person. Besides, we have plenty to share."
5,4,0,Adora,Sorry. And thanks. I'm Adora.
5,4,0,Other,Jewelstar. And it doesn't matter.
5,4,0,Other,"Once we get the thulite crystals, we're blasting off, and rations won't be a problem."
5,4,0,Adora,The pink crystals? That's my my friends and I are here.
5,4,0,Other,"Yeah, but they're pretty much impossible to get to. Stashed away--"
5,4,0,Other,In the center of this cave that--
5,4,0,Other,Is falling apart because of the--
5,4,0,Adora,Earthquakes?
5,4,0,Other,We're stranded until we can get them.
5,4,0,Adora,We can't be stuck here. There's no time. Horde Prime invaded Etheria. I have to stop him before he takes it.
5,4,0,Other,"If he's on your planet, it's already over. This place used to be a safe harbor for travelers across the galaxy. Then Horde Prime arrived. Now we're just scavenging the remains. Same as he did to our home world."
5,4,0,Other,"If you're smart, you'll run away. Far, far away. Like we're trying to do."
5,4,0,Adora,"Well, I'm not. Running away, that is. I am smart. Never mind. Look, I'm a part of a rebellion, fighting the Horde. Once my friends find me and we get fuel, I'm going to face Prime, and I'm gonna stop him."
5,4,0,Other,Wow! Really?
5,4,0,Adora,"Really. Why don't you help us fight back? You've got the tech and the weapons, wh--You could do so much more than just scavenge. You could--"
5,4,0,Other,Get killed? Prime has already taken our home. Do you think we'd be on this wreck of a planet if we had a choice? Horde Prime always wins. He's unstoppable.
5,4,0,Other,And you're just one girl with a stick. What could you possibly do?
5,4,0,Adora,"Well, I used to be stronger. But that doesn't matter. If everyone works together, I know we can take him down. He has to pay for what he did, and he--He has someone on his ship. Someone I--We're stopping him. Period."
5,4,0,Other,"If your friend is with Prime, it's already too late."
5,4,0,Adora,"Oh, no. Catra is not my friend. I mean, she's--she used to be, but that was a long time ago, and she's tried to kill me a bunch of times since then, but then she saved Glimmer. And maybe that means there's still good in her, and now I don't know. It's... It's complicated."
5,4,0,Other,Everything seems really complicated with you.
5,4,0,Other,"Whatever she is, friend or not, she's gone. There's no point in going back for her. No one stands up to Prime and survives. I'm sorry."
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Bow, wait up! Bow! Would you please slow down?"
5,4,0,Bow,I just wanna get back to the ship.
5,4,0,Adora,It's all right. They're my friends.
5,4,0,Other,They don't sound like friends.
5,4,0,Adora,Are you guys--?
5,4,0,Bow,We're fine. Who are the space pirates?
5,4,0,Adora,"These are the Star Siblings. They're after the same thing we are, and we should all be working together. You know where the fuel crystals are, and we can help. What do you say?"
5,4,0,Entrapta,Hello!
5,4,0,Other,Okay. How many of you are there?
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Several. Adora, I came as fast as I could to warn you. Darla's sensors indicate that this planet is a apparently a hotbed of seismic activity."
5,4,0,Adora,"Yeah, uh, we kind of learned that the hard way."
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Well, Darla and I figured out an algorithm to predict the tremors and we're sort of running out of time before the really big one hits. So, are we getting the thulite now or..."
5,4,0,Other,Fine. We need to hurry. Let's go.
5,4,0,Other,"Once we get to the cavern, you'll--"
5,4,0,Other,Be awesome and hold the--
5,4,0,Other,Then Jewel will cover Glory and me while we wing fling.
5,4,0,Other,Just absolutely not.
5,4,0,Other,You're saying you won't cover me? You kind of have to. You're my big brother.
5,4,0,Other,"Yeah, ouch, Jewel. Cold."
5,4,0,Other,"No, just--of course I'll--just don't do anything fancy. Get the crystals and get out. We don't want another--"
5,4,0,Other,Eridani.
5,4,0,Other,Or Aquarii. We should not have gotten fancy there.
5,4,0,Other,Uh! Think fast.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"You guys are pretty close, huh?"
5,4,0,Other,"Yeah. Growing up under the threat of Horde Prime does that to you. We've lost a lot, but we still have each other."
5,4,0,Glimmer,Uh...
5,4,0,Other,There it is. That's the thulite.
5,4,0,Bow,We have to get over that?
5,4,0,Other,The chasm is wider than last time we tried. It's getting worse. This whole planet is falling apart.
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Uh-uh...according to these readings, there's gonna be another quake soon."
5,4,0,Adora,"A bridge! If we knock this column over during the next quake, we could bridge the gap and get across."
5,4,0,Other,"It's risky, but it might work. Everyone, get ready."
5,4,0,Entrapta,"Three, two, one!"
5,4,0,Other,Let's do this.
5,4,0,Other,No! That's our only way out.
5,4,0,Adora,No.
5,4,0,Glimmer,What's happening?
5,4,0,Bow,Glimmer!
5,4,0,Glimmer,Bow!
5,4,0,Other,It won't hold! We need to turn back!
5,4,0,Bow,Jump! I'll catch you!
5,4,0,Glimmer,We can't! This is our one shot.
5,4,0,Bow,It's too dangerous!
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Please, Bow. Just trust me, okay?"
5,4,0,Other,Ahh...!
5,4,0,Other,Your friend better hurry.
5,4,0,Entrapta,Uh-oh!
5,4,0,Adora,"Uh-oh. What do you mean ""uh-oh?"
5,4,0,Entrapta,Slight hiccup in my calculations. The seismic activity is increasing faster than anticipated.
5,4,0,Other,What does that mean?
5,4,0,Entrapta,We're out of time. They need to come back now before this whole place breaks apart!
5,4,0,Glimmer,You can do this.
5,4,0,Other,"We need to get out of here, now!"
5,4,0,Bow,Go! We're right behind you!
5,4,0,Bow,Glimmer.
5,4,0,Entrapta,There's no time!
5,4,0,Other,I can't hold it anymore.
5,4,0,Adora,No! Hang on!
5,4,0,Adora,My friends are on the other side. I am not going anywhere. I'm not leaving anyone behind.
5,4,0,Other,Was that magic?
5,4,0,Entrapta,She-Ra. I think that was She-Ra.
5,4,0,Glimmer,No!
5,4,0,Bow,Ready to do something that probably won't work?
5,4,0,Glimmer,Always.
5,4,0,Glimmer,Bow.
5,4,0,Bow,"Glimmer, are you okay?"
5,4,0,Glimmer,Yeah. I'm okay.
5,4,0,Adora,Come on.
5,4,0,Other,Wow! Oh! We did it. We actually did it.
5,4,0,Other,Did you see what she did?
5,4,0,Other,Thank you for helping us get the fuel. You Etherians are so reckless.
5,4,0,Other,Stubborn.
5,4,0,Other,"And brave. Magic hasn't been seen in the universe in centuries. But what I saw you do, you might actually be able to take on Prime. And we want in."
5,4,0,Other,We've spent our whole lives running away. But not anymore.
5,4,0,Other,We're going to fight Prime and take back our home.
5,4,0,Adora,Then welcome to the Rebellion.
5,4,0,Other,Two light stores replenished. Ship refueled.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Look, I know you're still mad at me. Maybe you'll be mad at me for a really long time. I deserve it. And maybe--maybe we'll--maybe we'll never be friends like we used to be. But I'm not going to stop trying to make it better. I made a mistake with the Heart of Etheria. I should have listened to you, and I'm sorry. You get to be mad, for as long as you need to be. But I'm not going anywhere. And when you're ready, I'll be here."
5,4,0,Bow,Okay.
5,4,0,Glimmer,Adora? Are you okay?
5,4,0,Adora,"Yeah. I just--look, I know this is gonna sound crazy and dangerous, and I know Catra was our enemy and she's done a lot of bad things and hurt a lot of people, but--"
5,4,0,Glimmer,You wanna go back for her.
5,4,0,Adora,Mm-hm.
5,4,0,Adora,I can't just leave her there. I have to try.
5,4,0,Glimmer,"Catra sacrificed herself to save me. Whatever you need to do, I'm with you."
5,4,0,Bow,Then let's do this. Best Friend Squad style.
5,4,0,Scorpia,Oh! Oh! What is it? What's going on?
5,4,0,Swift Wind,I felt her. She-Ra is back.
5,5,0,Other,Alert. We are being pulled in by an outside force.
5,5,0,Adora,You won't find anything; I came alone. I hear Horde Prime's been looking for me. Figured it was time we met.
5,5,0,Other,Yes. You will be brought before Prime. And there you will receive your judgement.
5,5,0,Entrapta,Spacesuit testing officially a success. All suits stood up to ship's velocity with zero loss of life.
5,5,0,Glimmer,"Wait, what? That was a possibility?"
5,5,0,Bow,We're in. They didn't find us.
5,5,0,Adora,"Good. Be quick, and don't get caught."
5,5,1,Glimmer,"Okay, everyone, sound off. I'm heading to Horde Prime's holding cell to get Catra."
5,5,2,Bow,And Entrapta and I are going to hack into the ship's server and download any intel about Prime's weak points.
5,5,3,Glimmer,Look for a room with a lot of glowing tech in it. I remember them taking me past it when--when they took me to... That has to be the server.
5,5,3,Entrapta,"Then that's our access point! Although, as long as we're here, you wouldn't mind if I just took a few readings----okay. To the server room!"
5,5,4,Adora,"Okay, uh--everyone, just be careful."
5,5,4,Other,You will go alone.
5,5,4,Bow,"You've got this, Adora. Keep him talking."
5,5,4,Glimmer,"Knowing him, that is not going to be a problem."
5,5,4,Adora,Prime.
5,5,4,Horde Prime,Welcome...Adora.
5,5,5,Bow,Hey. You okay?
5,5,5,Glimmer,What?
5,5,6,Glimmer,You worried about me?
5,5,6,Bow,Maybe. Just...
5,5,7,Bow,"...Be careful, okay?"
5,5,7,Glimmer,Yeah.
5,5,8,Glimmer,You too.
5,5,8,Entrapta,Still no sign of the server room... This place is so big...and empty. Where are the vents? How does anyone get around in this place?
5,5,8,Bow,"Call you right back, gotta go."
5,5,8,Entrapta,That must be the server room.
5,5,8,Bow,Uh...Hello. Would you believe that we're the... inspectors?
5,5,9,Horde Prime,"Forgive my unseemly state. It is a tedious task, but a necessary one to maintain this vessel."
5,5,9,Adora,"This is how it's going to go. We're gonna make a deal. You're gonna give me Catra, and then you're gonna let me leave again, free and clear. I have something you want. A weapon that only She-Ra can activate: The Heart of Etheria. And if you don't do what I say, then I'll use it...and destroy you and your empire for good."
5,5,9,Adora,Is...is something funny?
5,5,9,Horde Prime,"You are not going to use the weapon, or you would have already done so. You would never risk the safety of your Catra."
5,5,9,Adora,You don't know me. And you don't know what I'm capable of.
5,5,9,Horde Prime,Oh...but I do.
5,5,9,Horde Prime,"I am old, far older than you can imagine. My brothers lend me their life force, and when one vessel fails me, I simply elect another. Thus, Prime has reigned eternal through the centuries. There is something so......familiar about you, Adora. A face I have not seen in a thousand years. Not since I faced your ancestors, and crushed their once-mighty empire beneath my heel. You call them the First Ones. And you are one of them, are you not, Adora?"
5,5,10,Bow,Whoa!
5,5,10,Entrapta,"Oh, come on, baby, come on!"
5,5,10,Entrapta,Hordak?
5,5,10,Bow,"Entrapta, no! What are you doing?!"
5,5,10,Entrapta,"Hordak... That's you, isn't it? I...brought it for you. I thought you might need it, do you recognize it? Do you....recognize me?"
5,5,10,Other,"You are trespassing, Prime shall hear of this, and his punishment shall be merciless, for Prime sees all--"
5,5,10,Bow,"No, no! Stay in there!"
5,5,10,Entrapta,"Well that's definitely not Hordak, so we can cross that one off our list."
5,5,10,Bow,I wasn't aware that we had a list!
5,5,10,Other,Where...am I? I cannot connect to the hive-mind. I am...alone? I am alone...
5,5,10,Entrapta,Uh-oh... We broke him.
5,5,10,Other,Horde Prime. How will he see my thoughts? How will he know that I am faithful?
5,5,10,Bow,"It's all right. We'll, uh...we'll tell him. O-okay, buddy?"
5,5,10,Other,You...you will tell him?
5,5,10,Bow,Uh...sure?
5,5,10,Other,You...know Horde Prime?
5,5,10,Other,Please...let me accompany you and prove myself worthy to Horde Prime.
5,5,10,Bow,"No, that's--that's really okay, uh--"
5,5,10,Entrapta,Can you open this door?
5,5,10,Bow,We're not keeping him.
5,5,10,Entrapta,"But we broke him! We're responsible for him now. Plus, he can open doors..."
5,5,10,Bow,Can you...take us to the server room?
5,5,10,Other,I would be honored to serve one who is a beloved of Horde Prime.
5,5,10,Bow,"All right, then, Wrong Hordak. Lead the way."
5,5,10,Bow,"Or...point and...I'll just keep dragging you. That's fine, too."
5,5,11,Glimmer,"Guys, I found the cell, but...Catra's not here. What do we do?"
5,5,11,Glimmer,Bow? Entrapta? ...Adora?!
5,5,12,Horde Prime,"I thought the First Ones were all gone, but clearly...some faction remains. That race of tyrants...abandoned you on a forgotten planet in a shadow dimension. They made you their weapon, their...She-Ra."
5,5,12,Adora,"I don't fight for the First Ones. I fight for my home, for myself, and for my friends. Now for the last time: where is Catra?"
5,5,12,Catra,Adora?
5,5,12,Adora,Catra? Where are you?
5,5,12,Horde Prime,"Of course. Your Catra. She hoped you would come for her...poor thing. So all I had to do was wait. As she would've said, ""You are so very predictable."" ...Come here, child."
5,5,12,Catra,"Hello, Adora."
5,5,13,Bow,"Come on, Wrong Hordak. Any clue where the server room is yet?"
5,5,13,Other,"Forgive me, brother. The ship is designed so that it may only be navigated by one who has access to the hive-mind....And I have been cut-off..."
5,5,13,Entrapta,"There's something in here! A big energy signal, this has to be it!"
5,5,13,Bow,"Adora, we found it! Adora...?"
5,5,14,Adora,What did you do to her?!
5,5,14,Horde Prime,I have made her anew. I saw her mind......so ensnared in grief and rage and pain...and I brought her to the light. Isn't that right... little sister?
5,5,14,Adora,"Catra, you have to fight it!"
5,5,14,Catra,"My place is with Horde Prime, Adora. I don't want to leave."
5,5,14,Horde Prime,Tell her what I've done for you.
5,5,14,Catra,"Prime has given me peace. Something you could never do. You broke my heart. But he has made it whole again. Don't you see? This is for the best. I'm happy here. You could be happy, too."
5,5,14,Adora,Let her go.
5,5,14,Horde Prime,"Shall we make a deal, Adora? I will give her to you, if...you want her... But first, you must do something for me. You...will give me She-Ra."
5,5,14,Adora,Never.
5,5,14,Horde Prime,Very well.
5,5,14,Horde Prime,"You miscalculated. I see all. I know all. You thought yourself worthy to challenge me...but you are nothing but a false hero, the last of the First Ones to fall at my hands. You have led your friends to destruction."
5,5,14,Horde Prime,"Go on, fulfill your purpose.Bring out She-Ra, and strike me down."
5,5,14,Horde Prime,Ah... but you two must have a lot of catching up to do. I will leave you to it. Let me know when you're ready to make a deal.
5,5,15,Glimmer,Hey. Remember me?
5,5,16,Adora,"Catra, listen to me. I know you're still in there. I'm not leaving without you."
5,5,16,Adora,It's gonna be okay--
5,5,16,Catra,"Everything is already okay. We are with Prime now. There is no need for you to suffer, Adora. Come into the light with me."
5,5,16,Adora,"Snap out of it, Catra. I don't want to hurt you..."
5,5,16,Catra,"...But you have already hurt me. Prime has set me free of that pain. The pain that you caused. He will set us all free...forever. A world of peace, without end."
5,5,16,Adora,Catra!
5,5,16,Catra,"Oh, Adora... How long will you drag this out? You will destroy the ones you love in the process."
5,5,16,Horde Prime,"Oh, Adora... How long will you drag this out? You will destroy the ones you love in the process."
5,5,17,Entrapta,"Horde Prime's server is infinitely more complex than anything I've ever encountered. It's like a neural network, branching off in every possible direction in a three-dimensional configuration."
5,5,17,Bow,What does that mean?
5,5,17,Entrapta,It means it's gonna take a lot longer to decipher than I thought!
5,5,17,Bow,We have to get out of here! Whoa!
5,5,17,Other,"Brothers, why do you attack? We serve Horde Prime's will."
5,5,17,Other,Enemies of Horde Prime will know the terror of his--
5,5,17,Glimmer,"I always hated that guy in particular. And also, all the other guys I hit on the way in."
5,5,17,Bow,Glimmer!
5,5,17,Glimmer,We have to get out of here!
5,5,17,Entrapta,But I haven't finished yet!
5,5,17,Glimmer,"There's no time. We might not be able to hack him, but we can still make him hurt."
5,5,17,Glimmer,Let's go!
5,5,18,Catra,"She was afraid, in the end. And she suffered. Perhaps I will make her my new vessel...though, she would not last me long. What do you think... Adora?"
5,5,18,Horde Prime,"She was afraid, in the end. And she suffered. Perhaps I will make her my new vessel...though, she would not last me long. What do you think... Adora?"
5,5,18,Adora,"I am not giving up on you, Catra!"
5,5,18,Catra,Then you're a fool. You cannot stop Horde Prime. He will reign triumphant over all the universe. It is...destiny--
5,5,18,Adora,No!
5,5,18,Catra,Adora...you should have stayed away. Why did you come back? We both know I don't matter...
5,5,18,Adora,You matter to me.
5,5,18,Adora,"Come on, Catra! You've never listened to anyone in your life! Are you really going to start now?!"
5,5,18,Catra,You're such an idiot...
5,5,18,Adora,Yeah...I know...
5,5,18,Adora,I'm going to take you home.
5,5,18,Catra,...Promise?
5,5,18,Adora,I promise!
5,5,18,Catra,...Adora...
5,5,18,Catra,Disappointing. Some creatures are destined only for destruction.
5,5,18,Horde Prime,Disappointing. Some creatures are destined only for destruction.
5,5,18,Adora,No!
5,5,19,Adora,...Catra? Catra? It's okay...I'm here.
5,5,19,Other,"I am sorry for the needless waste, Adora. It did not have to be like this. Are you ready to cooperate?"
5,5,19,Adora,...For the honor...of...GRAYSKULL!
5,5,20,Adora,You miscalculated.
5,5,21,Bow,What do we do?
5,5,21,Entrapta,"I've got an idea, but you have to promise that you won't be mad that I maybe, possibly, 100 percent disregarded all those times you told me not to tinker with the ship."
5,5,21,Bow,"Entrapta, if you get us out of here, you can tinker with the ship as much as you want!"
5,5,21,Entrapta,"Great! Hey, Darla!"
5,5,21,Entrapta,Good girl!
5,5,21,Bow,"We need to find Adora and get out of here, now!"
5,5,21,Bow,She-Ra...
5,5,21,Glimmer,She's back...
5,5,22,Other,Shields at 30 percent. Hull compromised. Interspace travel not recommended.
5,5,22,Other,"Administrator detected. Hello, She-Ra."
5,5,22,Adora,"Hey, Darla. Get us out of here."
5,5,22,Other,Affirmative.
5,5,22,Adora,And Darla? Make it quick.
5,5,22,Adora,"Come on, Catra. You're not done...not yet. We're going home."
5,5,22,Catra,"Hey, Adora..."
5,5,23,Hordak,...En...trapta?
5,6,0,Entrapta,"Okay, I patched the shielding on the aft starboard ancillary booster, try it now."
5,6,0,Bow,I have no idea what that is.
5,6,0,Entrapta,"I'm working on getting the autopilot up and functional again. Wrong Hordak, blow torch!"
5,6,0,Bow,"What? We couldn't just leave him behind. And he's harmless, you know, since I... kind of, you know, fried him and scrambled his brains..."
5,6,0,Glimmer,How's Catra?
5,6,0,Adora,"Good, I think. I j--I keep checking on her, but she's been sleeping for a while, do you think I should check on her again?"
5,6,0,Bow,"Adora, you should let her rest."
5,6,0,Adora,"Right, right. ...But what if she wakes up and needs something? I'm j-I'm just gonna go check on her-- No, no, no, you're right. Letting her rest."
5,6,0,Glimmer,"Come on, guys. We faced Horde Prime and made it out alive."
5,6,0,Bow,I honestly cannot believe it worked.
5,6,0,Glimmer,"Plus, She-Ra's back!"
5,6,0,Bow,How did you do that without the sword?
5,6,0,Adora,I don't know. I just...suddenly felt her again. Like she'd never left. Like she's been in there all along just waiting to come out... I just have no idea how to do it again.
5,6,0,Glimmer,You'll figure it out. What's important is that she was there when your friends needed her.
5,6,0,Bow,"Well, friends, and one person who threw me off a cliff once, but sure."
5,6,0,Glimmer,"Oh, I can't believe we're finally going home!"
5,6,0,Bow,Steering!
5,6,0,Glimmer,"Oh, sorry! Sorry."
5,6,0,Bow,"With Darla damaged, our speed's at 30 percent. If Entrapta can't fix it, it will take us a while to get there."
5,6,0,Glimmer,As long as we're headed towards home and away from Horde Prime...I'm happy. We deserve to celebrate... I'm going to make us a special dinner for tonight!
5,6,0,Bow,You? ...I have never seen you cook before.
5,6,0,Glimmer,...You know what? Wrong Hordak can help. I bet he knows a lot about cooking.
5,6,0,Other,I am honored to provide nourishment for my exalted brothers.
5,6,0,Adora,...I'm gonna go check on Catra again!
5,6,0,Bow,"Adora--! ...Okay, I can do this. Next stop, Etheria."
5,6,2,Horde Prime,Little sister. ...Catra...
5,6,2,Adora,"Hey! Hey, it's just me."
5,6,2,Adora,Are you...still getting the flashes?
5,6,2,Catra,"Yes, I keep having this horrible vision of a blonde girl who thinks she's better than everyone barging into my room all day. ...Oh, wait."
5,6,2,Adora,"...We'll find a way to get the chip off. If you'd just...let Entrapta take a look at it, I bet she could--"
5,6,2,Catra,"I don't wanna see anyone, okay?! Not you, not Arrow Boy, or Sparkles, and definitely not Entrapta."
5,6,2,Adora,"So, you're just gonna hide in here forever? You'll have to face them sometime..."
5,6,2,Catra,"No, I don't. Just--drop me off on the closest planet, I'll make my own way."
5,6,2,Adora,"What, so Horde Prime can capture you again?"
5,6,2,Catra,I can take care of myself.
5,6,2,Adora,"I promised I'd take you home, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do. Why are you acting like this?! We saved your life!"
5,6,2,Catra,"I told you not to come back! But you just love feeling like a hero, don't you?"
5,6,2,Adora,You'd rather I left you there to die?!
5,6,2,Catra,WHAT DO YOU CARE?! I know you all hate me!
5,6,2,Adora,I never hated you!
5,6,2,Catra,...Then you're even dumber than I thought. Just...leave me alone.
5,6,2,Adora,"...I'm such an idiot. I thought things would be different this time, but clearly, nothing has changed."
5,6,3,Swift Wind,"I'm telling you, I felt her! I did. She-Ra is back!"
5,6,3,Netossa,"Oh, no you don't!"
5,6,3,Frosta,Yeah!
5,6,3,Other,"Huh, weird winds today..."
5,6,3,Netossa,"What do you think you're doing, you're supposed to be on my team!"
5,6,3,Other,"Darling, we're doing this to cheer her up?"
5,6,3,Frosta,I am the undefeated champion of ice ball!
5,6,3,Netossa,"You know that doesn't count, right?"
5,6,3,Micah,"Ready, kiddo?"
5,6,3,Frosta,"""Kiddo""? I'm the ruler of my own kingdom, got it, old man?"
5,6,3,Other,"Don't take it personally, Frosta's been having a rough time lately. This invasion has her pretty freaked out."
5,6,3,Micah,Do kids not like me? How do I make kids like me? Is Glimmer not gonna like me when she comes home?!
5,6,3,Netossa,"Okay, see, now it looks like you're taking it super personally."
5,6,3,Micah,...I need your help. We got word that the Horde was sighted near Elberon. We have to go check on them.
5,6,3,Swift Wind,"Did you say Elberon needs help? YES! ...I mean, boo, for them... But they throw the best victory parties! Dibs on this mission."
5,6,3,Netossa,"Parties? Maybe Frosta should come, too. We could all use some fun. Hey, Frosta!"
5,6,4,Adora,"Catra is driving me crazy! I thought we actually stood a chance at fixing things this time. But after everything we've been through, she's still a stubborn brat!"
5,6,4,Glimmer,This is Catra we're talking about. Did you think she was going to just instantly become a totally different person?
5,6,4,Adora,"No, I just-- I thought she'd at least try. We all risked our lives to save her, and she can't even say thank you? Can you believe that?"
5,6,4,Other,I believe...in Horde prime.
5,6,4,Adora,"Uh...what's he doing here, again?"
5,6,4,Glimmer,"Oh, he's helping me make dinner."
5,6,4,Other,True nourishment comes from the favor of Horde Prime. ...Also from nutrient-rich amniotic fluid.
5,6,4,Glimmer,"Yeeeaaaah, well, we're not eating that. I think these rations were Mara's. Does space food expire? What does this one say?"
5,6,4,Adora,"""Dehydrated protein slaw."" ...Yum?"
5,6,4,Bow,"Guys, you'd better get in here!"
5,6,5,Adora,What's going on?
5,6,5,Bow,Sensors picked up Horde ships on our tail. They're coming straight for us.
5,6,5,Glimmer,"It's gotta be a coincidence, Prime can't track this ship."
5,6,5,Adora,"Well, is there somewhere we can hide until they're gone?"
5,6,5,Entrapta,"Look! It's an asteroid field. It would be so fun--I mean, a-a great hiding spot. But, Bow said I couldn't fly into it..."
5,6,5,Bow,"Asteroids. Ship, falling apart."
5,6,5,Adora,"Well, nobody has a better idea, so it'll have to do."
5,6,5,Other,Projected course not recommended.
5,6,5,Bow,Acknowledged...
5,6,6,Micah,"Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you ride on my shoulders? Glimmer and I used to do it all the time."
5,6,6,Frosta,That's little kid stuff. And I don't need your help.
5,6,6,Swift Wind,"Gonna beat those bots / And smash some drones / Then eat me some ice cream cones / Hey, where are all those drones?"
5,6,6,Netossa,Where is anyone? I thought this town was supposed to be in danger.
5,6,6,Other,"Welcome to Elberon, rebel heroes."
5,6,6,Micah,We came as quickly as we could. Where are the Horde forces?
5,6,6,Other,You are mistaken. I'm so sorry we made you worry. And you came all this way... Why don't you stay for supper?
5,6,6,Micah,Well... I really could go for some cake!
5,6,6,Frosta,Cake? Really?
5,6,6,Micah,Do kids not like cake anymore?
5,6,6,Swift Wind,"Oo, wait till you see this-- party..."
5,6,7,Bow,"Okay, we should be safe in here. Even if they're looking for us, we'll be impossible to spot among the asteroids."
5,6,7,Other,We have taken damage. Hull integrity at 60 percent.
5,6,7,Entrapta,Horde ships coming right for us!
5,6,7,Adora,How did they find us?!
5,6,7,Entrapta,"Horde Prime may not be able to track Darla, but something on board is sending up a trace signal. That must be what they're following!"
5,6,7,Adora,"Those flashes Catra's been getting, the signal's coming from her chip, isn't it? Once again, Catra is ruining our lives."
5,6,7,Bow,"Wait, Entrapta hasn't fixed the shields yet!"
5,6,7,Adora,Then try not to hit anything!
5,6,8,Swift Wind,Something weird is going on...
5,6,8,Frosta,"Yeah, this place is giving me the creeps."
5,6,8,Frosta,Maybe it's time to go...
5,6,8,Micah,"Hey, why don't we start a game of ice ball? That should liven things up!"
5,6,8,Micah,My daughter's gonna hate me...
5,6,8,Netossa,Where have you been? You know I don't like being alone at parties.
5,6,8,Other,Something really weird just happened...
5,6,8,Netossa,I know. This whole place is weird.
5,6,8,Frosta,We're going back. There might be someone who actually needs help.
5,6,8,Swift Wind,I don't know what happened to these guys. Their last party was great. It's like they've been replaced with totally different people.
5,6,8,Other,It's getting dark outside... You don't want to be out in the dark.
5,6,8,Micah,We really should get back to camp.
5,6,8,Other,But our guest of honor hasn't arrived. Stay...and join us in the light of Horde Prime.
5,6,10,Catra,"What is she doing in here?! I told you, I want to be alone!"
5,6,10,Adora,Entrapta's going to remove your chip.
5,6,10,Catra,You're going to let her operate on me? She'll kill me!
5,6,10,Entrapta,"Me? Why would I wanna hurt you? Oooh, you mean because you sent me to Beast Island, stole my work, and used it to rip a hole in the fabric of space and time? I get it. ...HOLD STILL!"
5,6,10,Catra,Stay away from me!
5,6,10,Adora,"Catra, Horde Prime is tracking that chip. He's coming for us right now, so grow up and let us remove it, or we're all dead."
5,6,10,Adora,"We're doing this. Then if you think hiding from the people you hurt will make you feel better, we'll drop you off and you'll never have to see us again. ...You'll never have to see me again."
5,6,10,Catra,"Adora, wait-- ...Please. Stay."
5,6,12,Other,"Come to Lord Prime's light, and you will find peace."
5,6,12,Micah,Wait!
5,6,12,Frosta,Stop treating me like a little kid! You don't need to protect me!
5,6,12,Micah,"I'm not protecting you, I'm protecting them. Horde Prime's done something to them...but they're innocent Etherians. We can't hurt them. You're the strongest one here. Use your power to defend the team."
5,6,12,Frosta,To me!
5,6,12,Netossa,What is happening?
5,6,13,Entrapta,Experiment number 982: Removal of embedded Horde chip. Let's begin.
5,6,13,Catra,Wait. Not yet.
5,6,13,Adora,"Catra, we don't have time."
5,6,13,Catra,"I can help you, okay? When Horde Prime was...using me, I felt--It's like, um... It's like all his clones are-are connected to some kind of hive mind, and I was part of it."
5,6,13,Adora,Those flashes you're getting?
5,6,13,Catra,"It's him. He's still in there, he can--he can see me. But maybe I can see him, too. I can find out what he's planning."
5,6,13,Adora,"No, you can't risk letting him back into your head."
5,6,13,Catra,"Adora, you have to let me try. Otherwise you're gonna do something stupid and get yourself killed. Just... Just stay with me, while I do it, okay?"
5,6,13,Catra,"I can feel him. He's--he's angry. He wants revenge. He wants to make you hurt, he's...attacking Etheria. No... no, no, no, not attacking. Something new is happening...there's so much noise. He's... He's chipping them. He-He's going to chip them all! Horde Prime is taking control of Etheria!"
5,6,13,Adora,No... He...he can't!
5,6,13,Catra,It's already happening. You've gotta stop him!
5,6,13,Bow,"Oh, I'm losing visuals! Where did that asteroid come from?! Glimmer, get over there and be my eyes!"
5,6,14,Other,"My children, why do you struggle? I wish to bring peace to your planet, yet...you reject it."
5,6,14,Swift Wind,"Uh--She-Ra! If you really are out there, are you getting this?!"
5,6,14,Other,Your She-Ra will not come to save you now.
5,6,15,Other,The hull has sustained multiple fractures. We will be unable to withstand another full-on strike.
5,6,15,Catra,"Adora, please... I--I want to go home."
5,6,15,Adora,We will. I'm getting us out of here.
5,6,17,Adora,Etheria needs us. And I won't let him hurt anyone else.
5,6,17,Catra,Where are you going?
5,6,17,Adora,To send Horde Prime a message. For the Honor...of Grayskull!
5,6,18,Other,"Welcome, children. You will be reborn in Prime's image."
5,6,18,Swift Wind,Wh-Whoa! Did you guys see that?
5,6,18,Netossa,We'll be impressed later. Let's go.
5,6,19,Entrapta,"Chip appears to be fused with the subject's nervous system, leeching energy in a parasitic exchange. Extraction is going to be a delicate process. Careful, now..."
5,6,19,Entrapta,Sorry!
5,6,19,Catra,Just get it off!
5,6,19,Adora,Tell Horde Prime: this is from me!
5,6,19,Glimmer,Veer left. Up...up!
5,6,19,Glimmer,"Wait, is that--?"
5,6,19,Glimmer,Yeah!
5,6,19,Bow,What is going on out there?
5,6,20,Entrapta,Almost... Allllmoooost...
5,6,20,Entrapta,"I did it! With the chip removed from its power source, it won't be able to signal anymore. ...Okay, gotta go check on Darla now!"
5,6,20,Catra,"...Entrapta, wait. ...Thank you. And...I'm sorry."
5,6,20,Entrapta,I forgive you.
5,6,21,Entrapta,Shields and autopilot are back online. Darla just needs some time to reboot and then she'll be back to full functionality.
5,6,21,Adora,She-Ra... She's really back... Like back for real.
5,6,21,Bow,"Good timing, too. We really need her."
5,6,21,Other,Brothers.
5,6,21,Glimmer,Who wants dinner?
5,6,21,Bow,Glimmer...You made these?
5,6,21,Glimmer,"Wrong Hordak helped. Everyone eat, eat! I used to make these with my mom. She wasn't that good a cook, either, so I figured it would be hard to mess up."
5,6,21,Adora,This is really good.
5,6,21,Bow,"Okay, hold up. Glimmer, this is amazing!"
5,6,21,Entrapta,"Oh, wow, this is delicious."
5,6,21,Adora,"Wait, you made these in the oven, from dehydrated slaw? This is so good!"
5,6,21,Glimmer,"How is it? It smells good, right?"
5,6,21,Entrapta,"Does this come in smaller sizes, though? It's hard for me to eat if it's too--"
5,6,21,Bow,"Did you see that asteroid that was coming right at us? Then Glimmer was like, ""Oh, no. Bow, stop."" and then I was like, ""Okay, I'll stop."" And I pulled up, then we missed it--"
5,6,21,Adora,This is almost better than--
5,6,21,Other,I put amniotic fluid in there. ...That was a joke.]
5,6,22,Other,We--We've gotta go back for them.
5,6,22,Micah,We will. But first we need to figure out what that was. And how to stop it.
5,6,22,Swift Wind,"She-Ra will know. She's coming home, I can feel it. She's getting closer every day."
5,6,22,Frosta,Sorry for calling you an old man. Glimmer's really lucky to have you as a dad.
5,6,22,Micah,Really? You think so?
5,6,22,Frosta,"Yes, but you really gotta stop trying so hard."
5,6,22,Netossa,"We don't know who we can trust now. But as long as we all stick together, we'll get through this."
5,7,0,Adora,"Okay, She-Ra, I know you're in there."
5,7,0,Bow,"Oh, you almost had it."
5,7,0,Adora,Will you stop distracting me?!
5,7,0,Bow,"Sorry, but there definitely was some glow-y action going on there."
5,7,0,Glimmer,"Come on, Adora. You can't let distractions keep you from transforming."
5,7,0,Catra,What's going on? Ooh! Are we messing with Adora?
5,7,0,Adora,"Catra, do you have to sit right there?"
5,7,0,Catra,What? I'm not doing anything.
5,7,0,Glimmer,"Adora, concentrate!"
5,7,0,Catra,"Yeah, Adora, concentrate."
5,7,0,Bow,You can do it.
5,7,0,Entrapta,This way!
5,7,0,Entrapta,"Oh, hi, Adora. Don't mind us."
5,7,0,Adora,"Entrapta, do you have to do that in here?"
5,7,0,Entrapta,Yes. This is where the signal is strongest. We're less than a day out from Etheria. We'll be in range to send a message to the Rebellion soon.
5,7,0,Glimmer,"I, I can't believe...I'm a day away from meeting my dad. It's been so long. I barely remember him."
5,7,0,Adora,Ready to be home?
5,7,0,Catra,"Not really. Okay, fine. Maybe."
5,7,0,Bow,What do you think's going on right now on Etheria?
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Our friends have still not returned from their perilous space mission. So, it's up to us to save Etheria. Onward, to a secret, underwater party adventure!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Okay, so, it's not that I didn't understand the plan, but I didn't understand the plan. Why are we dressed like this?"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,Because it's a secret undercover mission to find Prince Peekablue. The reclusive Peekablue is a hermit. But he was spotted at the top-secret Enchanted Grotto's underwater soiree. A gathering place for all well-heeled criminals of Etheria.
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Hmph! So, he'll show up to a criminal enterprise, but won't so much as RSVP to my drum circle so I know how many drums to have?"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"All right, yeah, I got it. And, uh, why do we need him?"
5,7,0,Mermista,"Because Peekablue has the power of Farsight. He can magically see to the edges of the universe and if we recruit him, he can tell us where Adora and the others are. We have to warn them that Prime is chipping people on Etheria and get them back ASAP. No one at the soiree can know we're there. So, I've assigned everyone undercover aliases."
5,7,0,Mermista,"Scorpia, you're Lynda D'Ream, a farmer and mother to five little scorpions."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"""Lynda D'Ream""? I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm not exactly great at lying or pretending or blending in. I mean, I'm just the muscle. Not a spy."
5,7,0,Mermista,"Nonsense, Lynda. You were born for this role. Perfuma, you're Tara, a blacksmith."
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Ooh! I love it. What if Tara has an unmatched skill at cards and wears an eye patch and has a dark, checked past and an evil twin? Ooh! I can play the evil twin."
5,7,0,Mermista,"Keep it simple, Tara."
5,7,0,Mermista,"Okay, the sooner we find the prince, the sooner we figure out where our friends are."
5,7,0,Other,There you are.
5,7,0,Netossa,"Hey, you."
5,7,0,Other,Any chance I could steal you away for a moment?
5,7,0,Netossa,"Not now, darling. After what happened at Elberon, we need to focus on the next move for the Rebellion."
5,7,0,Other,Please? It'd only take a second.
5,7,0,Netossa,I don't have the time.
5,7,0,Other,"Oh, yeah, sure. I understand."
5,7,0,Netossa,"Is it me, or is she....mad at me?"
5,7,0,Swift Wind,I don't know. It honestly doesn't seem like she's feeling much of anything.
5,7,0,Netossa,"It's our anniversary! And I completely forgot. Oh, I gotta fix this, Swifty."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,The dolphins roll in the tide at dawn.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Secret, underwater party adventure!"
5,7,0,Mermista,Why are we in a broom closet?
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Yeah, where's the soiree?"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Oh, this isn't the soiree."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,This is the soiree.
5,7,0,Mermista,"This place is swimming with bounty hunters, pirates and sirens who would sell us out in a beat of their cold-blooded hearts. We need to blend in, and find the prince quickly and quietly. Do not ruin this for me."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,You don't have to tell me twice. These are my people. I just have to work the room and--
5,7,0,Mermista,Ugh! What is it?
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Oh, no, nothing, nothing, nothing. I just didn't know, uh, he'd be here."
5,7,0,Mermista,"I thought these were your ""people."""
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,They are my people. Which means that most of them have sworn revenge against me at some point.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Quick! Let's, uh, go mingle. Over there."
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Okay, it's game time. Tara's gonna go chat up those fellas. You go mingle with those ruffians there. Good luck, Lynda D'Ream."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Oh, gosh."
5,7,0,Perfuma,"What a lovely shindig, huh? My word, that sword is very pointy."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"I really hope this doesn't get in the way of rekindling...I.... Wrong word. Uh, relighting our friendship. Nope, that's--that's bad, too. Look, I'm sorry I set your boat on fire. Do you forgive me?"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Excellent, I'll take that as a ""yes."""
5,7,0,Mermista,"Sea Hawk, focus. This cannot be like the time you ruined the Cephalopods Literary Society."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Aw, don't worry. Now that he can't blow my cover, it's smooth sailing from here."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Yeah. Totally. So, underwater, huh? Things? Yeah, yeah, yeah... Peekablue? Anybody? No? Nobody? Okay. Well, uh...never mind. Well, good night."
5,7,0,Perfuma,"And that's when I told him, I don't even know how to swim."
5,7,0,Mermista,Please tell me that's the last of your disgruntled former cohorts.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Uh, perhaps we should just stay back here?"
5,7,0,Perfuma,How did it go? Did you find out anything?
5,7,0,Scorpia,Yeah. I found out I'm really bad at this.
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Don't say that. That--that's just the old you talking, consumed with all the self-doubt the Horde instilled in you."
5,7,0,Scorpia,I'm just--I'm not really the leading-lady type.
5,7,0,Perfuma,That's nonsense. You're amazing. You have the biggest heart and you could do whatever you put your mind to.
5,7,0,Scorpia,Really?
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Okay. What do you, Scorpia, like to do?"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Well, I always liked singing. But I'm bad. Everyone said so. Well, Catra said so, it's fine."
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia, you should do things not because you're good at them but because they make you happy. Follow me, okay? Repeat after me: I can do this. I can do this."
5,7,0,Scorpia,Perfuma can do this. Perfuma can--
5,7,0,Perfuma,"No, no, no. You can do this. Heh. Say ""I."""
5,7,0,Scorpia,I--I can do this? I can do this. I can do this. I can find Prince Peekablue!
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Yes! That's the spirit. We'll find him, even if he's hidden in the darkest, most secluded corner of Etheria."
5,7,0,Other,"Good evening, misfits of the sea, outlaws of the land and everyone in between. I'm your host, Prince Peekablue!"
5,7,0,Other,Peekablue! Prince!
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Wow, I guess I don't know what a hermit is after all."
5,7,0,Other,"We've got a great evening of entertainment for you. Singers, dancers, and if your lucky, a little bit of Farsight for you."
5,7,0,Perfuma,This is our chance. I'm gonna go get Mermista and Sea Hawk. Don't take your eyes off Peekablue.
5,7,0,Other,"Next up, we got Swen on the piano. Give it up for Swen."
5,7,0,Netossa,How could I forget? Spinny probably has a great surprise planned and I'm going to have to plan something even better to beat her.
5,7,0,Mermista,"Okay, anyone else?"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"That's all of them. Now, at last, we're ready for secret, undercover and underwater party adventure!"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,Mermista? What is it?
5,7,0,Mermista,"Huh? Uh, nothing. Uh, nothing at all."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,Then why are you hiding behind the bar?
5,7,0,Mermista,Fine. There might be someone here that I absolutely cannot deal with right now.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,What? Who?
5,7,0,Mermista,"Someone whose boat I maybe, sort of, kind of set on fire."
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,What?!
5,7,0,Mermista,Shh! I just wanted to know what it felt like.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,You are everything I've ever wanted.
5,7,0,Mermista,Stop looking at me like that.
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Psst! Hey, is that you, Peekablue?"
5,7,0,Scorpia,Oh...Hi...uh...I'm Sco--Lynda. D'Ream? Hello.
5,7,0,Mermista,"Oh, I can't watch."
5,7,0,Scorpia,Trying to get backstage--performer--I'm a performer.
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Yay! Go, Lynda!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,I can do this. I can do this.
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Sneak, Don't make a sound"
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Oh, yes! Those pipes. Bravo!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,Oh. Thank you. Thank you. I did it.
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Swen? It's you! Oh, wow, Prince Peekablue, I have been looking all over for you."
5,7,0,Other,"That was quite a number, honey. But I really don't have time to chitchat."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Okay, yeah, but see, we need your powers to fight Horde Prime see where our friends are."
5,7,0,Other,Friends? Do you mean Glimmer and Adora?
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Wow, you're amazing. Come on, do it again. Can you see them right now?"
5,7,0,Other,"I can see...a bright, shiny woman among the stars with her great big sword, fighting against Horde Prime! She-Ra, in space!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Wait, fighting with her sword? But Adora broke the sword."
5,7,0,Other,"Farsight never lies, darling. Now I must insist you leave. I need to get into character for my next performance."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"""Character""? Hmm. Strangest thing, but I think we've met before."
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Oh, Perfuma's flower crown workshop."
5,7,0,Other,"Yes! Perfuma. She's a doll, isn't she? Never miss a shindig with her."
5,7,0,Scorpia,The real Peekablue has never met Perfuma. Who are you?
5,7,0,Scorpia,Double Trouble?
5,7,0,Double Trouble,Bravo. You caught me. Again.
5,7,0,Perfuma,What are you doing here? Where's the real Peekablue?
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"Wouldn't know. After things ended with my cash-kitten, I needed another gig. I had heard all about the elusive Peekablue. A seer who no one has seen in years? How could I resist?"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"So, thing whole mission has been a big waste of time."
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"I might not have the prince's gifts, but I know where your friends are. And I'll tell you. For a price, of course."
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"Fine. While I was wandering through occupied territories, I posed as a clone, trying to get in good with Big Brother. Turns out, it wasn't for me. It makes for a very dull audience when everyone's mind-controlled. Half the crowd out there is chipped."
5,7,0,Perfuma,What?
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"That's not all. Prime is angry. She-Ra showed up and stole his little kitten away. Your friends are on their way home, but Prime set up a blockade around the planet, ready to strike down anyone daring to pass. They'll never make it."
5,7,0,Netossa,"Hey, you. I'm so sorry about today. I forgot all about it."
5,7,0,Other,Don't worry. All is forgiven.
5,7,0,Netossa,You promise you're not mad?
5,7,0,Other,"I could never be mad at you, beloved."
5,7,0,Netossa,"""Beloved""? You've never called me that before. Show me your neck!"
5,7,0,Other,What a shame we can't be together. In Horde Prime's light.
5,7,0,Netossa,What have you done?
5,7,0,Double Trouble,Are we done here?
5,7,0,Perfuma,Mermista? What are you doing?
5,7,0,Mermista,Step out of the darkness and into the light of Prime.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"Mermista. Mermista, no!"
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"We are in a delicate underwater bubble. So, can you please stop hitting one another?"
5,7,0,Perfuma,We need to get out of here.
5,7,0,Scorpia,There's no way out.
5,7,0,Double Trouble,I know a way out. Take me to the stage! I mean it. Take me to the stage.
5,7,0,Double Trouble,"The theater has...um, a little help? I need to lift my hand to the heavens. The theater has many secrets."
5,7,0,Scorpia,I'll hold them off. Get on that platform and get out of here.
5,7,0,Sea Hawk,"That's your cue, hot stuff. Let's go!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Perfuma, go!"
5,7,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia, come on!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,There's too many of them. And this place is coming down unless someone stops it. You have to get out and protect the others.
5,7,0,Scorpia,Go. Now!
5,7,0,Perfuma,"What? No! You're coming, too!"
5,7,0,Scorpia,"Nah. This is why I'm here. I'm the muscle, remember? I can do this."
5,7,0,Netossa,I'm sorry!
5,7,0,Netossa,"Run, quick!"
5,7,0,Netossa,Happy anniversary.
5,7,0,Entrapta,Ha! A signal. We're in range. Patching us through to the Rebellion's communication line.
5,7,0,Perfuma,Adora?
5,7,0,Adora,Perfuma. What's going on?
5,7,0,Perfuma,I...I...
5,7,0,Adora,We're on our way back. Just hang on a little longer. We're almost there.
5,7,0,Perfuma,"No! Don't come back. Horde Prime knows you're coming. There's a trap, a blockade. You'll never make it through. You need to stay away. The Rebellion's been compromised. Horde Prime has them. We lost. I'm so sorry, we lost them."
5,8,0,Adora,Anything yet?
5,8,0,Bow,"Adora, I'm trying, but no one's answering. They're...gone."
5,8,0,Entrapta,Uh-oh. I think I found the blockade Perfuma was talking about.
5,8,0,Bow,That's a lot of Horde ships.
5,8,0,Glimmer,"How are we going to get through that? If I could use magic, I'd teleport us past it. I've never felt such a lack of magical energy in my life. Why does space hate me so much?!"
5,8,0,Adora,"Magic or no magic, we're going home."
5,8,0,Catra,"So, your plan is to, what, ram through an armada of ships?"
5,8,0,Adora,No! ...Maybe! We have to try.
5,8,0,Catra,"You heard Perfuma! They're waiting for us. They're going to catch us. And if they do... ...Take it from someone who's defeated you guys, like, a lot. Charging in without a plan won't work."
5,8,0,Adora,"Okay, well, you didn't defeat us."
5,8,0,Bow,"Adora, Catra's right. ...That felt weird to say. We barely made it out last time we tangled with Prime. We need to figure out another way to help our friends. Catra, you were with him. Does he have any kind of, I don't know, weakness?"
5,8,0,Catra,"What, you think he'd tell me?"
5,8,0,Other,"You are correct, brother. We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness."
5,8,0,Adora,"Uh, wh-huh, so that means, Horde Prime does have a weakness."
5,8,0,Other,No. Horde Prime is all-powerful.
5,8,0,Bow,You just said--
5,8,0,Other,We do not discuss Horde Prime's weakness. We do not discuss Krytis.
5,8,0,Glimmer,What's Krytis?
5,8,0,Other,"Krytis does not exist, and if it did, we would not discuss it."
5,8,0,Catra,It's a place. A planet.
5,8,0,Entrapta,"Krytis, Krytis, Krytis... Hmm. There's something here, but it's locked. We need administrator clearance to access it."
5,8,0,Adora,"Darla, show us."
5,8,0,Entrapta,"A-ha! According to Darla's records, it's located here, not too far from us!"
5,8,0,Other,"In-in-in-incorrect. It is located nowhere, because it does not exist, because Lord Prime destroyed it."
5,8,0,Catra,"I know what I saw. Prime's trying to hide something, and it has to do with this planet."
5,8,0,Adora,There's something on Krytis Prime doesn't want us to know about... and we're gonna find it. Set course for Krytis.
5,8,1,Bow,Prime was definitely here.
5,8,1,Adora,But something made him leave.
5,8,1,Entrapta,This place should have some log of the invasion. Maybe Wrong Hordak can connect to it and tell us what happened here.
5,8,1,Entrapta,"Good news, my readings show that the atmosphere is safe."
5,8,1,Catra,"What? She's been wrong before. A lot, actually."
5,8,1,Bow,"If my helmet were that adorable, I'd leave it on, too. Those ears!"
5,8,1,Catra,It is not!
5,8,1,Entrapta,"I'm picking up a heat signature. There's someone alive on this planet, right here, somewhere in this Spire."
5,8,1,Other,I-i-impossible. Prime destroyed all life here on this planet that does not exist.
5,8,1,Adora,"Well, he missed someone, and we have to find them."
5,8,1,Entrapta,Pulling up the Spire's schematics now. We'll guide you through from here.
5,8,1,Catra,"So, wait, the plan is to barge ahead into the structurally unsound building to find some mystery person that we know nothing about, in hopes that they somehow know how to defeat Horde Prime?"
5,8,1,Adora,That about sums it up.
5,8,1,Bow,"Yeah, pretty much."
5,8,1,Glimmer,"Yep, that's the plan."
5,8,1,Catra,"Honestly, what did I expect."
5,8,1,Bow,"You know, we were just gonna recklessly blast our way through that blockade until you stopped us. So this whole thing is basically your idea."
5,8,1,Glimmer,"Yeah, it's kind of your mission."
5,8,1,Catra,"No, it's not--"
5,8,1,Bow,"Catra's first mission, Catra's first mission!"
5,8,1,Glimmer,"Catra's first mission, Catra's first mission!"
5,8,1,Catra,"Ugh, I am going to kill your friends."
5,8,1,Adora,Please don't.
5,8,2,Castaspella,I came as soon as I heard-- What--? What do you think you're doing?
5,8,2,Castaspella,I don't understand how this happened. Surely this can't be everyone who's left?
5,8,2,Perfuma,We-- We need to find another place to make camp. They know we're here. They could be back at any time.
5,8,2,Castaspella,"So, that's it? We're going to hide?"
5,8,2,Perfuma,Just until we figure out what to do. Maybe we could go to Mystacor. It has that invisibility spell.
5,8,2,Shadow Weaver,"That's not going to work. With Micah controlled by Prime, Mystacor is already compromised."
5,8,2,Castaspella,"How did the Rebellion lose so many of our finest members, and yet we're still stuck with you? We're wasting time here. We need to seek out the Horde and get my brother back. I lost him once, I'm not gonna lose him again."
5,8,2,Perfuma,We need to get out of here! We need to make sure the rest of the Rebellion is safe first.
5,8,2,Shadow Weaver,"If you want to help Micah, come with me."
5,8,2,Castaspella,You can't seriously think I would ever go anywhere with you.
5,8,2,Shadow Weaver,You don't have a plan. I do.
5,8,2,Castaspella,"Fine. But if you try anything, I won't hesitate to strike you down."
5,8,3,Adora,That's weird.
5,8,3,Catra,Cool. Maybe this planet chased away Horde Prime with poorly planned architecture.
5,8,3,Entrapta,Why'd you stop? Go through the door right in front of you.
5,8,3,Bow,Entrapta...there's no door.
5,8,4,Entrapta,"Well, the schematics show a door right where you're standing. Data never lies."
5,8,4,Other,The logs say Lord Prime...retreated from this planet? Oh...this cannot be. Lord Prime...does not retreat. He is...the almighty conqueror. His dominion is just and eternal.
5,8,4,Entrapta,I don't know how many times I have to repeat myself: Data never lies!
5,8,5,Entrapta,"Uh...I mean... there, there?"
5,8,5,Catra,"Ah, whatever. We need a door? There's your door. You're welcome."
5,8,5,Bow,"Uh, we don't know what we're dealing with here. Maybe you shouldn't just smash stuff."
5,8,5,Catra,Do you wanna find whoever is here or not? Let's just get this over with.
5,8,5,Bow,It's some sort of mineral growth. ...It's eating away at the Spire.
5,8,5,Catra,You have an arrow that turns into a magnifying glass? I can't believe we were losing to you guys.
5,8,5,Bow,Glimmer? You okay?
5,8,5,Glimmer,Uh...I--I don't know. I have a weird feeling about this place. It feels... strange.
5,8,5,Adora,"Entrapta, this floor is clear. Where to now? Entrapta?"
5,8,5,Entrapta,Sorry. Seems Wrong Hordak has begun to question the meaning of life.
5,8,5,Other,Who am I if not an exalted brother of Prime?
5,8,5,Entrapta,But don't worry! I've got it totally under control!
5,8,5,Adora,"Okay, any sign of those life readings?"
5,8,5,Entrapta,I'm picking up something on the next level!
5,8,5,Adora,Upstairs. Let's go.
5,8,5,Bow,Aww. That's your sneeze?
5,8,5,Catra,What?
5,8,5,Bow,It's just so...cute!
5,8,5,Catra,It's a normal sneeze!
5,8,5,Bow,"I can't believe the whole time you were trying to kill us, you had the cutest sneeze of all time!"
5,8,5,Catra,I am not cute!
5,8,5,Bow,"The angrier you get, the cuter you are!"
5,8,5,Adora,Catra!
5,8,5,Catra,Get me out of this thing!
5,8,5,Glimmer,Bow! I think this feeling I had about this place is a bad feeling!
5,8,6,Castaspella,"Don't look at me like that. You could slow down, you know. Where are we going?"
5,8,6,Shadow Weaver,"There's no time, you need to keep up."
5,8,6,Castaspella,"You said you had a plan. The only reason I'm following you is because if anyone would know about mind control, it's you."
5,8,6,Shadow Weaver,Mind control? Is that what they told you? No. My gifts were always far subtler.
5,8,6,Castaspella,Then you're wasting my time. I'm going back.
5,8,6,Shadow Weaver,"You never held a candle to Micah's power as a sorcerer. Neither did I. We both know how dangerous he is now that his magic is controlled by the enemy. We won't be able to stop him. He could do irreparable damage to others, and...to himself."
5,8,6,Castaspella,So what is your plan?
5,8,6,Shadow Weaver,We make ourselves stronger.
5,8,7,Catra,What was that? Why did that wall try to eat me?!
5,8,7,Adora,Isn't this where we started?
5,8,7,Bow,"You guys hear that, too, right?"
5,8,7,Entrapta,The energy signature is just ahead of you. Go through the door on your left.
5,8,7,Adora,Door? W-what door?
5,8,7,Catra,We're not really going through that...are we?
5,8,7,Adora,"Well, Entrapta says this is the way, so, let's go."
5,8,7,Catra,Seriously?! How have you guys stayed alive this long?
5,8,8,Entrapta,"Adora! Are you there? Wrong Hordak downloaded the rest of the records from Prime's occupation of Krytis, and guess what?! This planet was once a First Ones colony like Etheria. It looks like Horde Prime and the First Ones were fighting for control of this planet, and Horde Prime won. But something on the planet drove him away before he could conquer it. He tried to erase all records of his failure."
5,8,8,Other,Horde Prime lied to us.  He...is not all-powerful.
5,8,9,Adora,See?! We're on the right path!
5,8,9,Bow,But we have to get out of here first. And that door still isn't getting any closer.
5,8,9,Entrapta,"Sorry, what door?"
5,8,9,Catra,"What do you mean, what door? The one you told us to go through."
5,8,9,Entrapta,That wasn't me. This is the first time we've talked since the last floor.
5,8,9,Catra,"I knew it! I knew this was a terrible plan! This place is weird, and unnatural, and we need to get out of here before--!"
5,8,9,Entrapta,"By the way, who's your new friend?"
5,8,9,Glimmer,What are you talking about? It's just the four of us.
5,8,10,Entrapta,"Hate to disagree, but there's a definite heat signature, right behind you."
5,8,11,Adora,Catra! Catra!
5,8,11,Catra,Adora! I'm down here!
5,8,11,Adora,I'm coming!
5,8,11,Catra,Hurry.
5,8,12,Bow,"Adora, what do we do?"
5,8,12,Adora,"I don't know, just--just nobody move!"
5,8,12,Bow,Glimmer! What are you doing?
5,8,12,Glimmer,"Hang on, I have to try something."
5,8,12,Glimmer,Illusions. These are all illusions. Then that means--
5,8,12,Glimmer,"I knew I was feeling something about this place. I thought it was bad, but it's--it's not! It's magic."
5,8,12,Adora,Catra!
5,8,13,Adora,Catra! Hold--on?
5,8,13,Adora,Are you--are you petting the thing that's been trying to kill us?
5,8,13,Catra,"I'm trying something here, if you didn't notice..."
5,8,13,Bow,It's just so...cute!
5,8,13,Catra,It's not cute!
5,8,13,Adora,Get away from her!
5,8,13,Catra,No...! Don't. I'm sorry. I got angry. It's something I'm working on.
5,8,13,Adora,"Aww, you are?"
5,8,13,Catra,"Yes! Now can you please-- Yes, I am. I think this thing responds to emotions. So can you not give me a hard time right now?"
5,8,13,Adora,"No, sorry, sorry. Do your thing."
5,8,13,Catra,It's okay. We won't hurt you.
5,8,13,Adora,You're--you're magic aren't you.
5,8,13,Adora,"Me, too."
5,8,13,Catra,"Uh, what's it doing?! Uh, guys? Can you hear it talking, too? Please tell me you can hear it talking."
5,8,13,Bow,It must have imprinted on you. It...trusts you.
5,8,13,Catra,"Well, it shouldn't. Why is everything with you guys so weird?"
5,8,13,Catra,"It says its name is...Melog. It's been here by itself for a long time. It thought we were enemies, like, um, the ones that came to take its magic? They dug into the ground, built machines."
5,8,13,Adora,"The First Ones. That's what they were doing. They were mining this planet's magic, just like on Etheria."
5,8,13,Catra,"But they took too much. And then...""the one who destroys"" came."
5,8,13,Catra,"He tried to conquer this place, but-but couldn't. The magic of Krytis was too wild for Prime. He didn't understand what it was. He couldn't use it, couldn't defend against it..."
5,8,13,Glimmer,Magic is Horde Prime's weakness!
5,8,13,Catra,Melog drove Prime off but couldn't defeat him. And now...it's the last of its kind.
5,8,13,Adora,"I'm sorry for what happened to you, but we're gonna make sure it never happens again. Our planet has magic, too. It might be the last place in the universe that does. If you wanna come with us, I think you'd really like it there."
5,8,13,Adora,Entrapta? We're on our way back down. And we're bringing a friend.
5,8,13,Entrapta,That's great! And I'm happy to report that Wrong Hordak's existential crisis has resolved.
5,8,13,Other,"Brothers! Horde Prime lied to us. He is a false ruler. We must rise up against him, and free the universe from his unjust reign!"
5,8,13,Adora,That's the plan!
5,8,13,Bow,"Uh, Adora? We still don't know how we're gonna get back to Etheria."
5,8,13,Catra,"Hmm, about that. I think I might have an idea."
5,8,14,Castaspella,"I can't believe I fell for this. You don't care about Micah. All you've ever cared about is getting more power for yourself. Well, I'm putting a stop to this right now!"
5,8,14,Shadow Weaver,"Everything we were taught in the Sorcerer's Guild was wrong. The First Ones didn't enhance this planet's magic with their tech, they weakened it. Etheria isn't a weapon. It's a living creature. And its magic has been here the whole time, slumbering, waiting to be awakened. Prime has taken our strongest fighters, but he does not yet know what this planet really is. We can destroy the restraints the First Ones built, set the magic of Etheria free... and use it against him."
5,8,14,Castaspella,You just want to take the magic for yourself.
5,8,14,Shadow Weaver,"I want to save Micah. I owe him that much, at least. Come with me. Help me undo what the First Ones did, and... stop me if I try to take the power for myself."
5,8,14,Castaspella,You better believe I will.
5,8,15,Entrapta,Coming up on the blockade around Etheria. They'll have visual on us soon.
5,8,15,Bow,We sure this is gonna work?
5,8,15,Adora,Only one way to find out.
5,8,15,Catra,Ready?
5,8,15,Glimmer,"So, just to make sure I get it, we're going to go running through a Horde blockade while relying on the magic of a creature we just met?"
5,8,15,Catra,"That about sums it up, yes."
5,8,15,Entrapta,"Punch it, Darla!"
5,8,15,Adora,It worked... It worked! Ah! Melog did it!
5,8,15,Glimmer,Catra saved the daaay!
5,8,15,Bow,"Aw, come here!"
5,8,15,Bow,Best Friend Squad huuug!
5,8,15,Catra,"No, no, absolutely not!"
5,8,15,Adora,We made it. We're home.
5,9,0,Glimmer,Oh! I missed this.
5,9,0,Catra,Really? 'Cause I could stand to never do it again.
5,9,0,Other,This place is a true blessing. What is this tingling sensation?
5,9,0,Bow,"That's warmth, buddy. Welcome to a living planet."
5,9,0,Adora,"Hey, I think you guys should take a look at this."
5,9,0,Glimmer,No. Where is everyone?
5,9,0,Adora,There was a fight.
5,9,0,Entrapta,"Makes sense. Perfuma said the Rebellion was compromised. If someone in camp got chipped and went after the rest, it would've been chaos."
5,9,0,Bow,"Adora, what if--? What if there's no one left?"
5,9,0,Adora,"We don't know that. They might have just moved camp. Wherever they are, we need to find them."
5,9,0,Glimmer,Maybe they went back to Bright Moon? Or maybe my dad took them to hide out in Mystacor?
5,9,0,Catra,We can't just traipse into your old hangouts and play nice with your pals. We don't know who's chipped.
5,9,0,Glimmer,"Wow, you don't trust the Princesses? I am shocked."
5,9,0,Entrapta,Really? That seems very in character for her.
5,9,0,Adora,Catra's right. We should gather intel first so we don't fall into a trap.
5,9,0,Bow,Erelandia is the closest village to camp. Maybe someone there knows what happened.
5,9,0,Glimmer,I'm on it.
5,9,0,Catra,How about a warning next time?
5,9,0,Glimmer,Sorry. Welcome to...
5,9,0,Glimmer,Erelandia.
5,9,0,Horde Prime,How many now?
5,9,0,Other,"At least a dozen occupied planets. We are stamping out the dissidents, but their message is spreading. They say they are revolting against the Horde in the name of...the Rebellion...and...of She-Ra."
5,9,0,Horde Prime,"My heart aches for these misguided children. Now more than ever, I am assured of my plan to use the Heart of Etheria to bring peace to all the universe. But without She-Ra, we must find another way to activate it. Find the dissenters and make an example of them. It is time to crush this spark of rebellion for good. Send word to our dear sister on Etheria."
5,9,0,Adora,"The townspeople might be able to tell us what happened to the Rebellion, but we need to keep a low profile. We should be able to avoid detection as long as we stick with Wrong Hordak. Let's go."
5,9,0,Other,"Brother, uh, I hope you, too, are full only of love for Horde Prime and have no crippling doubt eating at your soul."
5,9,0,Other,Glory be to Horde Prime.
5,9,0,Other,Ah...
5,9,0,Entrapta,"Nice job, Wrong Hordak. You blend right in."
5,9,0,Other,You appear to have a facial tic. Is it cause for concern?
5,9,0,Entrapta,"Huh? Oh, I'm winking. It signals unspoken intent behind my words. In this case, our mutual deception of the Horde. Now you try."
5,9,0,Other,"Oh, expressing facial emotion is a privilege reserved only for Prime."
5,9,0,Entrapta,Which is exactly why you should do it.
5,9,0,Other,Oh.
5,9,0,Entrapta,Now you've got it.
5,9,0,Adora,"Oh, there's a local. I'm gonna go talk to him. Um, hi there. I was just wondering if--"
5,9,0,Other,"I don't know anything. Please, just let me go. I was just trying to get home."
5,9,0,Adora,We're not going to hurt you. We just--
5,9,0,Other,Glory be to Horde Prime. Glory be to Horde Prime.
5,9,0,Catra,Hmm. No chip. But something is making the locals real skittish.
5,9,0,Glimmer,You think?
5,9,0,Catra,"If these people are scared, they're more likely to sell us out to Prime than tell us anything useful."
5,9,0,Catra,We should just go.
5,9,0,Adora,Not until we find out if there's any sign of the Princesses here.
5,9,0,Bow,"Leave this to me. You may all have magical powers and alien pets, but what we need now is the team's resident regular guy. They'll talk to me. Hey there. I'm just your average traveler passing through. Would you mind if I asked you a few questions about your lovely town?"
5,9,0,Other,Uh...what is it you want to know?
5,9,0,Bow,Have you seen any Princesses around these parts?
5,9,0,Other,Princesses? Where?
5,9,0,Bow,"So, obviously, at least some of our friends were here recently and made an...impression."
5,9,0,Catra,"A town that hates Princesses? Should I buy property here? Is what I would of said before I joined you. Go, team."
5,9,0,Adora,"We should split up and look around. Whoever it was could still be close. Catra, you take Entrapta and Melog. Keep them safe, okay?"
5,9,0,Adora,Let's move out.
5,9,0,Bow,"After everything the Rebellion's done for Etheria, how could people be afraid of the Princesses?"
5,9,0,Adora,"We've been gone a while, Bow. Things are worse here than when we left. You can't blame people for being scared of..."
5,9,0,Other,...suspicious dissenters. They're over there.
5,9,0,Adora,"them...Cover for us, okay?"
5,9,0,Other,"Yes, brother."
5,9,0,Adora,Did you just--? Did you just wind at me?
5,9,0,Other,Brothers! There is nothing to see here. Please move along.
5,9,0,Other,Glory be to Horde Prime.
5,9,0,Other,"Oh, no. I don't want any part of this. You're wearing hooded cloaks. It's highly suspicious. Are you hiding form the Horde? I'll call for help."
5,9,0,Bow,"No need for that. We're just, uh...browsing."
5,9,0,Bow,So...it seems like things have been pretty bad around here lately.
5,9,0,Other,Things are bad everywhere. We're all just trying to get through the day without any trouble.
5,9,0,Bow,"So, what, you're all just giving up and letting Prime take over?"
5,9,0,Other,"Well, what else are we supposed to do?"
5,9,0,Adora,"Bow, be cool. Undercover, remember?"
5,9,0,Bow,"Well, I'm just a completely objective third-party observer. But Erelandia should join the Rebellion and fight back."
5,9,0,Adora,"Oh, yeah. That's nice."
5,9,0,Other,"The Rebellion? The Rebellion is on the Horde's side now. If it's not clones attacking us, it's Princesses."
5,9,0,Glimmer,"No. No, it's not their fault. It's Prime's chips controlling them--"
5,9,0,Other,Do you think that makes a difference to us?
5,9,0,Glimmer,"Well, there are still some Princesses fighting for Etheria."
5,9,0,Adora,"Okay, well, there she is."
5,9,0,Other,"Queen Glimmer, I--I--I'm sorry. Please, I don't want any trouble."
5,9,0,Bow,We're not with the Horde.
5,9,0,Other,"Someone is coming, brothers. Ah?"
5,9,0,Adora,That's not how winking works. Is someone coming or not?
5,9,0,Entrapta,"Once I get these samples analyzed, we'll know if the Princesses were here in approximately four to six weeks."
5,9,0,Catra,Found them.
5,9,0,Entrapta,"That's the windy one, right? Isn't she with us?"
5,9,0,Catra,Not anymore.
5,9,0,Adora,"Spinnerella, this isn't you. You have to fight the chip."
5,9,0,Other,My fight is over. Lord Prime has given me peace. It's time for you to join us.
5,9,0,Glimmer,Not...today.
5,9,0,Adora,Prime really did it. How--? How are we supposed to fight our own friends?
5,9,0,Catra,It never stopped you before.
5,9,0,Netossa,"Hey, guys, welcome back."
5,9,0,Other,"Hello, beloved."
5,9,0,Netossa,"Spinny, don't."
5,9,0,Glimmer,We've gotta go.
5,9,0,Netossa,No. Wait!
5,9,0,Horde Prime,Brother?
5,9,0,Hordak,"Yes, Lord Prime?"
5,9,0,Horde Prime,Come with me.
5,9,0,Horde Prime,"There is something I am forgetting. It plays at the edges of my mind. Etheria. Long ago, I heard that name before, though it fell on different ears. Prepare the vessel. I must access the memories stored in this version."
5,9,0,Horde Prime,The First Ones sought a new source of power of ancient worlds. Why? Why bend themselves to the whims of magic and myth?
5,9,0,Horde Prime,"The fools took their secrets with them when they died. But I will find another way. Is there something wrong, little brother?"
5,9,0,Hordak,"It is an honor to bask in the glory of your former selves, Lord Prime."
5,9,0,Netossa,What were you thinking?
5,9,0,Bow,"Netossa, I'm so glad you're okay."
5,9,0,Netossa,Why'd you do that? I've been tracking Spinny for days. I almost had her.
5,9,0,Catra,Looked more like she almost had you.
5,9,0,Netossa,Catra? Stand back. I'll handle this one.
5,9,0,Catra,What one?
5,9,0,Adora,"Netossa, it's a long story, but she's with us now."
5,9,0,Netossa,Really?
5,9,0,Adora,Yeah.
5,9,0,Netossa,"Watch out, a clone!"
5,9,0,Other,Uh...
5,9,0,Adora,"He's, uh---he's actually on our side, too."
5,9,0,Netossa,"So, the only person I'm fighting here is...my own wife?"
5,9,0,Adora,"Netossa, what happened to everyone else?"
5,9,0,Netossa,"They got Spinny first. And she got to the others. She chipped them. Mermista, Scorpia...King Micah. Prime is forcing them to attack the people of Etheria, to attack us. The other Princesses are in hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, but I can't wait for them. All I know is, I have to get Spinnerella back. Whatever it takes."
5,9,0,Bow,We were gone. We weren't here to help our friends. And the people we were supposed to be fighting for have lost all hope in us.
5,9,0,Adora,Horde Prime tore our home apart. He took our friends. He's not gonna stop until he's taken everything from us.
5,9,0,Glimmer,"Netossa...I'm sorry. We should've been there. But we're here now and we're not giving up. We've never faced greater odds than this. But for everything Prime has thrown at us, he still hasn't managed to stop us."
5,9,0,Glimmer,We're going back for Spinnerella and for the people of Erelandia and to show Prime that Etheria's not done fighting yet. We'll need everyone's help to pull this off. So?
5,9,0,Adora,We won't let Prime win this one.
5,9,0,Entrapta,I'm in.
5,9,0,Other,"I am honored to fight beside you, brothers."
5,9,0,Catra,Sure. Why not? I have some experience taking out Princesses.
5,9,0,Netossa,Thank you.
5,9,0,Other,I swear I wasn't helping She-Ra. I didn't even know it was her.
5,9,0,Other,Prime rewards honesty from his children. Tell us where she is and you will be absolved.
5,9,0,Other,The rebels have been sighted in the outskirts of the woods. Come at once.
5,9,0,Other,Where are the rebels?
5,9,0,Other,Right beside you. Ah?
5,9,0,Glimmer,Gotcha.
5,9,0,Catra,You're clear.
5,9,0,Catra,You go deal with Spinnerella. We'll take care of the bots.
5,9,0,Adora,Be careful.
5,9,0,Catra,Always am.
5,9,0,Other,"Please, I have nothing to do with her. You have to believe me."
5,9,0,Adora,The shopkeeper. No wonder she didn't trust us.
5,9,0,Netossa,"Adora, what if...she can't come back from this?"
5,9,0,Adora,She's still in there. She needs you to remind her who she is. And we need to remind Prime who we are. For the honor of Grayskull!
5,9,0,Netossa,New look?
5,9,0,Netossa,Spinnerella!
5,9,0,Other,"Welcome back, beloved."
5,9,0,Other,Queen Glimmer?
5,9,0,Glimmer,We won't abandon Erelandia.
5,9,0,Netossa,What are you doing?
5,9,0,Adora,I'm trying not to hurt her.
5,9,0,Netossa,Stop holding back. She won't.
5,9,0,Netossa,That's more like it.
5,9,0,Netossa,"Spinny, stop. It's me, Netossa. Please. I love you. Come back to me."
5,9,0,Other,Netossa?
5,9,0,Netossa,Spinny! Is that you?
5,9,0,Other,Darling.
5,9,0,Netossa,No!
5,9,0,Netossa,"She's still in there. I saw her. We can get her back, I know it."
5,9,0,Other,Huh?
5,9,0,Netossa,It's good to have you guys back.
5,9,0,Catra,"She'll, um...She'll be okay. Spinnerella. After the chip, I mean. I, uh, have some experience."
5,9,0,Other,Princesses.
5,9,0,Bow,"Well, technically, I'm not actually--"
5,9,0,Other,"I still think you sort are trouble, but thank you for freeing our town. I don't know what we can do, but if the Rebellion ever needs it, you can always find a friendly face in Erelandia."
5,9,0,Other,Oh! Ah.
5,9,0,Catra,I think Horde Prime is going to know She-Ra's back.
5,9,0,Adora,Good.
5,9,0,Horde Prime,"Set coordinates for Etheria. Clearly, I am going to have to handle this embarrassment myself."
5,9,0,Glimmer,This is where the Rebellion is hiding out?
5,9,0,Netossa,Yep. Why? Have you been here?
5,9,0,Bow,"Oh, I can't wait to see every--"
5,9,0,Perfuma,Show us your necks!
5,9,0,Netossa,"Perfuma, they're good."
5,9,0,Perfuma,Your necks!
5,9,0,Frosta,She's clear.
5,9,0,Perfuma,"Oh, Bow! Bow, it's really you!"
5,9,0,Frosta,"Ah, Glimmer!"
5,9,0,Glimmer,Frosta!
5,9,0,Adora,Swift Wind!
5,9,0,Entrapta,"Emily! Wrong Hordak, meet Emily."
5,9,0,Bow,"All right, let--let it out."
5,9,0,Perfuma,I don't wanna be in change anymore!
5,9,0,Adora,"Hey, come here. It's time for you to officially meet everyone."
5,9,0,Catra,You sure?
5,9,0,Catra,Are you serious?
5,9,0,Frosta,"Deadly serious, Horde scum."
5,9,0,Adora,"Frosta! It's--it's a long story, but Catra's with us now. Okay?"
5,9,0,Frosta,Fine. But I still don't like her face.
5,9,0,Adora,She can live with that.
5,9,0,Perfuma,Did you find her?
5,9,0,Netossa,"I did, but..."
5,9,0,Adora,"Spinnerella got away, but we'll get her back. We'll get all of our friends back. There's still a chance to save them. This war has only just begun."
5,10,0,Adora,"Mermista, Spinnerella, and Scorpia are wreaking havoc across Etheria. If we wanna stop Horde Prime, we have to neutralize them and figure out how to free them from their chips."
5,10,0,Netossa,Leave this to me. I've been keeping track of every Princess' weakness. And I've discerned the best tactical strategy to overpower every one of them. Spinny's weakness is obvious.
5,10,0,Adora,"Uh-huh, uh-huh. Real obvious. And, um, ahem, what is it exactly?"
5,10,0,Netossa,"Everyone knows she twisted her ankle when she was a kid. If you keep her off balance, her injury will act up on her. Next time we fight, I'll target it, and subdue her and un-chip her and save her and remind her of it every time she tells me it's my turn to clean."
5,10,0,Bow,Right. But could we circle back to your not-at-all-weird-and-very-detailed theories on our weaknesses?
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Yeah, not all of us will be as easy as a twisted ankle."
5,10,0,Netossa,"Oh, you don't believe me. That's--That's fine. I'll just demonstrate. Entrapta's weakness: tech."
5,10,0,Netossa,"Mermista's: fire. Frosta's: also fire. Adora can't act to save her life. Also, extreme hair-envy with She-Ra. Glimmer: crippling self-doubt mixed with overwhelming hubris."
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's, like, really personal compared to fire."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Oh, oh, do me. Do me next."
5,10,0,Netossa,Perfuma: fire. And an inability to unleash your full power due to your overwhelming fear of hurting the people you care about.
5,10,0,Perfuma,Some might say that's actually a positive quality.
5,10,0,Netossa,It's not. Bow's weakness...
5,10,0,Bow,"You've spent a lot of time thinking about this, huh?"
5,10,0,Netossa,"Contingency plans are how you win, and I always win."
5,10,0,Catra,"Okay, we get it. Princesses are easy to take down. You and your files don't have anything on real threats, like me."
5,10,0,Adora,"We need to stop the chipped Princesses before they hurt anyone else. We've lost track of Spinnerella after Erelandia, but there is good news. We know where Scorpia is. Bow? Uh, Bow?"
5,10,0,Bow,"Huh? Oh, uh, right. After wreaking havoc on a town along the coast, Scorpia returned to the Fright Zone."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"If Scorpia went back to the Fright Zone, that has to mean something. There's probably a part of her that remembers it's her home."
5,10,0,Catra,That pile of junk isn't anyone's home.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia saved me. She stayed behind so the rest of us could escape the Enchanted Grotto. If anyone can resist Horde Prime's programming, it's Scorpia. Her heart's too strong. She'd never hurt her friends."
5,10,0,Catra,"Yeah, she's not great at standing up to authority figures, trust me."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Your negative vibes aren't appreciated here, Catra."
5,10,0,Catra,"Look, all that matters is the chip. Going for the back of the neck is how we take out Prime's clones. And the only reason that Adora, you know, saved me or whatever, is because the chip got damaged first. That's how we free them."
5,10,0,Perfuma,You think you know how to save Scorpia better than I do? I know all about how you treated her back in the Horde. Things are different now. Scorpia knows the kindness of a true friend.
5,10,0,Perfuma,Hoo. Hmph.
5,10,0,Adora,"Hey, we all want to save Scorpia, so, let's work together to do it. If we make our way through the desert, we can enter the Fright Zone through here. Catra, Melog, we'll need you to cloak us."
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Bow, are you okay?"
5,10,0,Bow,"Yeah, yeah. I'm fine."
5,10,0,Glimmer,"It's your dads, isn't it?"
5,10,0,Bow,"I know they're probably fine. The Library is really well hidden, but I haven't heard from them since we got back."
5,10,0,Glimmer,We should go check on them. I'll teleport us there.
5,10,0,Bow,"But, what about the mission? Scorpia and the others are controlled by Prime and your dad might be with them."
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Bow, Adora and the others can handle Scorpia. This mission is just as important. We have to make sure your dads are safe."
5,10,0,Bow,I'm really worried about them.
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Then let's go. Wherever they are, we'll find them."
5,10,0,Adora,"It's weird, isn't it? Being back. So many memories here."
5,10,0,Catra,Most of them bad.
5,10,0,Catra,"Hey, bet I can still beat you to the forge."
5,10,0,Adora,"Uh, because you always cheat."
5,10,0,Adora,Huh.
5,10,0,Adora,"Well, it's different than I remember it."
5,10,0,Catra,Hordak and I may have had a small disagreement before we were taken by Horde Prime.
5,10,0,Adora,Whoa.
5,10,0,Perfuma,Scorpia?
5,10,0,Catra,What is she doing?
5,10,0,Perfuma,Scorpia?
5,10,0,Adora,Get back here.
5,10,0,Netossa,No. Does no one understand what stealth means?
5,10,0,Perfuma,Scorpia?
5,10,0,Catra,Your plans are just the worst.
5,10,0,Perfuma,Scorpia?
5,10,0,Netossa,What's she doing? Why isn't she attacking?
5,10,0,Perfuma,She recognizes us. I told you she'd never hurt her friends. Scorpia?
5,10,0,Adora,Perfuma!
5,10,0,Perfuma,She must not be able to tell that it's us.
5,10,0,Catra,Whoa.
5,10,0,Catra,"Scorpia...uh, it's me. Look, about everything that happened...I'm really--"
5,10,0,Adora,Catra!
5,10,0,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
5,10,0,Netossa,Pretty sure she can tell it's us.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Yes, but I mean, it's Catra. Can we really blame her?"
5,10,0,Bow,Something doesn't feel right.
5,10,0,Bow,Whoa!
5,10,0,Bow,Prime Bots.
5,10,0,Bow,"They're here, right by my home."
5,10,0,Bow,Lance? George?
5,10,0,Glimmer,Hang on. I'll check the other rooms.
5,10,0,Glimmer,They aren't here.
5,10,0,Bow,What if Horde Prime has them? What if he chipped them?
5,10,0,Glimmer,We don't know that. Maybe they went somewhere safe.
5,10,0,Bow,All of Etheria is under Prime's control. They can't defend themselves. They're dads. And now they've been taken by Horde Prime.
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Uh, Bow?"
5,10,0,Bow,I should've never learned archery. I should've never left home. Then none of this would've happened.
5,10,0,Glimmer,Bow!
5,10,0,Glimmer,What does it say?
5,10,0,Bow,"It says, ""What did the First One say when they burned dinner? It was ruined."""
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Uh, what does that mean? I don't speak dads."
5,10,0,Bow,I know where they are.
5,10,0,Catra,That could've gone better.
5,10,0,Catra,"Hey, I'm working on being a better friend. That has to count for something, right?"
5,10,0,Catra,Scorpia's not alone.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Her positive energy is being blocked by all of Prime's negative energy. We need to--She-Ra, drop it. Drop it. We don't throw tanks at our friends."
5,10,0,Adora,"Yeah, well, this isn't working. Look at her. It's like she doesn't even recognize us."
5,10,0,Netossa,"Perfuma, enough with the feelings. You could be one of the strongest Princesses if you'd just--"
5,10,0,Perfuma,I am strong! But I'm not gonna hurt my friend.
5,10,0,Adora,"Oh, I really wish she'd stop doing that."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia, please stop. You don't have to do this anymore."
5,10,0,Other,Still trying to save everyone? What a wasted effort.
5,10,0,Netossa,This one's mine.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Netossa, wait."
5,10,0,Adora,"Oh, so, she gets to throw tanks at us."
5,10,0,Glimmer,"Oh, ""It's ruined."" I get it. That's...terrible. Why do you think they came here?"
5,10,0,Bow,"They were excavating it, looking for First Ones artifacts. It would've been the last safe place to go."
5,10,0,Lance,"Bow? Oh, Bow! Oh, and Glimmer. We didn't hit you, did we? Sorry. We're so sorry."
5,10,0,Other,"I'm still teaching him how to use this thing. And I don't know how to use it either. So, um, it's good you're here."
5,10,0,Lance,You got our message.
5,10,0,Other,"I knew you'd ""pun-derstand."""
5,10,0,Bow,You will not distract me with puns right now. I've been so worried. You haven't responded to any of my messages.
5,10,0,Lance,Our tracker pad's been on the fritz. And you know we're useless with that kind of thing. We left a note.
5,10,0,Bow,You can't just work on ancient history like nothing's happening.
5,10,0,Other,You were the one who inspired us to fight for what we believe in. We're not hiding down here. We found something. Something that we think might help everyone.
5,10,0,Glimmer,What did you find?
5,10,0,Lance,It's easier if we show you. Come on.
5,10,0,Mermista,Hiding is pointless.
5,10,0,Mermista,Show yourself and kneel before Horde Prime's might.
5,10,0,Catra,Not a chance.
5,10,0,Netossa,You're not going anywhere.
5,10,0,Other,"Oh, but you are."
5,10,0,Netossa,You can't get rid of me that easily.
5,10,0,Perfuma,How can Prime do this? Scorpia was so full of light and kindness. And he stripped that away. He--He erased her. He erased our friendship.
5,10,0,Adora,Oh no.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia, please. We're trying to help you."
5,10,0,Adora,Come on.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Adora, what happened to She-Ra?"
5,10,0,Adora,"I--I don't know, I just--I lost her."
5,10,0,Adora,"Come on, Sword."
5,10,0,Horde Prime,"Ah, She-Ra."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Anytime She-Ra wants to come back, that would be great."
5,10,0,Adora,You. What are you doing here?
5,10,0,Horde Prime,It was long past time that I saw for myself what made Etheria so very special. Starting with my brother's amusing little stronghold.
5,10,0,Adora,"I told you before, you're not getting She-Ra."
5,10,0,Horde Prime,"Oh, my sweet child, I have no need for you. Not anymore. My little brother's research has given me everything I need to know. The technology of this planet is familiar to me. Ancient, crude, outdated. It will be child's play to bypass its defenses and take the weapon at its heart for myself, with...or without you."
5,10,0,Other,"We unearthed an ancient secret, long forgotten. A rebellion from the time of the First Ones, fighting against a powerful tyrant, just like we are. Watch. Eternia."
5,10,0,Other,"Greetings, administrator. What is your query?"
5,10,0,Bow,"Uh, that's cool, Dad, but we met her a while ago. She, uh, wasn't that helpful."
5,10,0,Lance,"Oh, that's not it. We found something hidden in her programming."
5,10,0,Other,For the honor of--
5,10,0,Lance,Let me do it this time.
5,10,0,Other,You always get to do it.
5,10,0,Lance,I don't. You did it last time.
5,10,0,Other,"Okay, fine."
5,10,0,Lance,"For the honor of Grayskull! Oh, I love doing that."
5,10,0,Other,Your voice is amazing.
5,10,0,Lance,"Oh, thank you."
5,10,0,Glimmer,Wow.
5,10,0,Other,We weren't sure what to think when we first found this. We thought it must be a glitch.
5,10,0,Lance,But then we remembered that message on your tracker pad and how it used coded language based on the star formations of the distant past.
5,10,0,Other,"""Friend of..."""
5,10,0,Lance,"Uh, not that one. It's just--"
5,10,0,Other,"I've got it.""Mara."" There."
5,10,0,Other,"Greetings, friends of Mara."
5,10,0,Glimmer,Mara.
5,10,0,Lance,Mara wasn't alone. She was working with a group of rebels going against their First One's leaders.
5,10,0,Other,There is one recording available. Would you like to review?
5,10,0,Lance,Play it.
5,10,0,Other,"This is our last transmission. If anyone's hearing this, you need to listen. There's a fail-safe for the Heart of Etheria. It will allow you to destroy the Heart and end this for good. It's at the Arxia outpost, but we lost touch with them a week ago. If there's anyone left out there, you need to find it. Mara bought us time, but it's too late for us. This is Rebel Squadron Grayskull. And for the last time, we're signing off."
5,10,0,Bow,A fail-safe. There's a fail-safe to destroy the Heart of Etheria. This could stop Prime from using the Heart. This could save the universe.
5,10,0,Glimmer,They said it's at Arxia? What is that?
5,10,0,Lance,"That's what we don't know. The First Ones had different names for everything on Etheria. But in all our studies, we've never heard of a place called Arxia."
5,10,0,Bow,"We have to tell Adora. If there's a fail-safe out there somewhere, we need to find it."
5,10,0,Bow,Whoa. Are you okay?
5,10,0,Catra,"Get us out of here, now."
5,10,0,Glimmer,What's going on?
5,10,0,Catra,This whole thing was a trap. Why did I get the Water Princess?
5,10,0,Adora,You're lying. You will never get your hands on the Heart of Etheria.
5,10,0,Horde Prime,"It is over, Adora. You will not be able to stop me. As always, your childish fixation on saving your friends has distracted you. It has made you vulnerable, weak."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"You're wrong. There's power, real power, in love, joy, and friendship."
5,10,0,Horde Prime,And what could you possibly know about real power?
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Friendship isn't a weakness. It's my greatest strength. And it's Scorpia's, too."
5,10,0,Horde Prime,I've heard enough. End this now.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"Scorpia, you can break through this. I know you can."
5,10,0,Horde Prime,Submit yourself to inspection.
5,10,0,Horde Prime,No matter. They are insignificant. The plan is under way and the Heart will soon be in my grasp.
5,10,0,Other,It's almost over. Let go. Give in to Horde Prime's will.
5,10,0,Netossa,"Don't you get it, Spinny? I'm never letting you go. Because Spinny, you're my weakness."
5,10,0,Netossa,I got her.
5,10,0,Catra,"So, I heard Scorpia dropped a beam on you."
5,10,0,Perfuma,Scorpia missed. She missed on purpose.
5,10,0,Catra,How do you know?
5,10,0,Perfuma,I know because I believe in Scorpia.
5,10,0,Catra,I hope you're right.
5,10,0,Catra,Scorpia's really lucky to have a friend like you.
5,10,0,Perfuma,"It's hard keeping your heart open. It makes you vulnerable. But it doesn't make you weak, and I have to believe it's worth it."
5,10,0,Perfuma,"If you want, we can work through some guided meditation to begin to unblock your abandonment issues and you negativity."
5,10,0,Catra,"Nah. Uh-uh. No, one thing at a time, okay?"
5,10,0,Adora,A fail-safe. There's a fail-safe for the Heart of Etheria. Mara did it. This could work. We can still save everyone. We can stop the Heart of Etheria for good. Do we know what it is? Or where it is?
5,10,0,Bow,All we know is that it's supposed to be in some place called Arxia. Other than that...we've got nothing.
5,10,0,Shadow Weaver,We know where it is.
5,10,0,Shadow Weaver,We have to go to Mystacor.
5,11,0,Bow,"So, wait, hold on. Where have you two been this whole time again?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"While you were traipsing around in space, some of us have been working to stop the Heart of Etheria from falling into Prime's hands. And we discovered the same thing you did. Rumors of a Failsafe that will break the restraints the First Ones built and set the stolen magic free."
5,11,0,Glimmer,"Are you kidding? After everything that happened last time, you're still going after the Heart of Etheria? And you're helping her?"
5,11,0,Castaspella,We're trying to free the magic for all of Etheria so we can be strong enough to fight Prime. I'm doing this for your father and for you. Shadow Weaver is the lesser of two evils.
5,11,0,Catra,At least you admit she's evil.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"You're one to talk, aren't you?"
5,11,0,Adora,Tell us what you know about the Failsafe. What makes you think it's in Mystacor?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"As any good sorcerer knows, Mystacor was built on the ruins of an ancient First Ones citadel. And beneath Mystacor--"
5,11,0,Castaspella,"Ooh, ooh. Can I tell this part?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Go ahead.
5,11,0,Castaspella,"Beneath Mystacor, there are many secret tunnels and rooms, forgotten and sealed off. No one has been able to access them in centuries, but there are whispers of what they contain."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"An artifact known as the Crystal of Arxia, hidden there by a group of traitorous First Ones."
5,11,0,Castaspella,You said I could do it!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,You were taking too long.
5,11,0,Bow,Arxia. That must be the outpost that Mara's rebels were talking about! The Failsafe might be underneath Mystacor!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Reaching it won't be easy. But I have spent my whole life studying the secrets of Mystacor. I can get us in.
5,11,0,Adora,"If you figured it out on your own, why come back here? Why do you need us at all?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"Because Mystacor is controlled by Micah, who, you may recall, is controlled by Horde Prime. You have allowed Prime to take too much ground. If he seizes the Heart, it will all be over. There is no more time for half measures, Adora. You must act now."
5,11,0,Adora,"It's the only lead we have. We have to try. It'll have to be a stealth mission. Catra, do you think you and Melog can--?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"Oh, leave her to sulk. We can't let her slow us down."
5,11,0,Adora,You guys get ready. I'll find her.
5,11,0,Adora,Catra. Are you coming with us to Mystacor?
5,11,0,Catra,Why would I do that? Seems like you and Shadow Weaver have it handled.
5,11,0,Catra,"After everything she's done to us, you're really going to follow her?"
5,11,0,Adora,"I don't like it either, but this is the only plan we have. The Failsafe could finally save Etheria."
5,11,0,Adora,"Shadow Weaver hurt us. I haven't forgotten that. But Prime is hurting so many more people. I need to stop him, Catra."
5,11,0,Catra,"I know, I know. You have to go save the world. Spare me the speech."
5,11,0,Adora,"Hey, she can't do anything to us anymore. Please, come. We--I could really use your help."
5,11,0,Catra,Fine. But I'm only doing this to make sure Shadow Weaver doesn't try anything. Not because I like you.
5,11,0,Entrapta,Bow! I need to talk to you!
5,11,0,Entrapta,"I was finally able to remove Spinnerella's chip, but it was a lot more difficult than removing Catra's. The chip had almost entirely fused to her nervous system. If we'd waited any longer, I'm not sure we would've been able to get it off at all. The chip would've become a part of her."
5,11,0,Bow,That means we're running out of time to save everyone else.
5,11,0,Entrapta,"Yes. Luckily, I've got an idea. This is the network that connects all the chips to Prime's hivemind. If I can just figure out how to crack his signal pattern, I could disrupt it, severing his connection to the chips and taking them all offline at once!"
5,11,0,Bow,"That's amazing! We could free everyone on Etheria! You're a genius, Entrapta. Just keep working on it until you get it. We'll be back later tonight."
5,11,0,Entrapta,You got it!
5,11,0,Catra,No sorcerers here. Looks like we're--
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Keep your voice down.
5,11,0,Catra,Don't touch me!
5,11,0,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,We have to hurry!
5,11,0,Entrapta,Hmm.
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Uh, hey there, where're you going?"
5,11,0,Entrapta,I'm so close to cracking Prime's signal pattern! But Spinnerella's chip's not enough. I need to find a place with a high concentration of clones so I can analyze their connection to the hivemind!
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. You're just gonna walk into a place that's crawling with clones?"
5,11,0,Entrapta,Yep!
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Ugh, there's no way I'm going to stop you from doing this, is there?"
5,11,0,Entrapta,Nope!
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Oh, this is a terrible idea. Hop on. I can get you there faster, and get you out if there's trouble."
5,11,0,Entrapta,"Works for me! Thanks, Bird Horse!"
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"For the last time, I'm not--Just get this over with."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,We're here. Follow my lead.
5,11,0,Castaspella,"Would a ""please"" kill you?"
5,11,0,Glimmer,Whoa.
5,11,0,Adora,"Hey, are you--?"
5,11,0,Catra,I'm fine.
5,11,0,Adora,"Catra, it'll be okay. Trust me."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,There's no time to waste. News of our presence will have reached the others by now after that...disturbance.
5,11,0,Adora,Come on. We have to keep moving.
5,11,0,Bow,What is all of this?
5,11,0,Castaspella,"We're on the right path. The Crystal of Arxia was rumored to be the key to reaching deep magic within Etheria. Many have tried, and failed, to find it. But those who hungered for more power have long sought other ways to obtain the deep magic...with disastrous results."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"The Spell of Obtainment was a mistake, one for which I've paid the price. I don't see why you keep bringing it up."
5,11,0,Castaspella,You roped my brother into your twisted dark magic when he was only a child. You could've killed him.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"It would've worked had he not broken the connection. Micah was an exceptional sorcerer, even then. It's a shame it didn't run in the family."
5,11,0,Swift Wind,What is going on over there?
5,11,0,Entrapta,The patern is incredibly complex. I need more connections.
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"No way! Whatever's going on here, it's not good. No tech is worth you getting captured by Prime!"
5,11,0,Entrapta,"This isn't about tech. It's about our chipped friends. If I can get this to work, I can save them."
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Oh, okay, but be quick. I'll cover you from behind. Please be careful."
5,11,0,Entrapta,Yes! I've got it!
5,11,0,Hordak,Ahh.
5,11,0,Entrapta,Uh-oh.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Wait!
5,11,0,Catra,Adora!
5,11,0,Adora,I'm okay. I'm okay.
5,11,0,Adora,Did you just jump into fire for me?
5,11,0,Catra,What? No!
5,11,0,Catra,Shut up!
5,11,0,Adora,You did.
5,11,0,Glimmer,It's an illusion!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"Some of the fire is illusory, and some is real. Everyone, be careful."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,I see you and Catra are close again.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Do you really think that's wise?
5,11,0,Adora,It's none of your business.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"But it is. If your emotions are blocking you from becoming She-Ra, it's all of Etheria's business. How long has it been since you were able to transform?"
5,11,0,Adora,It's been happening ever since the Fright Zone. What if...? What if I'm losing her?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"She-Ra is a being of pure magic. To unleash her full strength, you must be focused, clearheaded. But you are letting your emotions pull you in too many directions. Catra, she distracts you, confuses you. Haven't you hurt each other enough? If you care about her, focus on protecting her. The world needs you as She-Ra right now, not Adora. And if She-Ra can't stop Prime, then we are all doomed."
5,11,0,Adora,I will stop Prime. No matter what.
5,11,0,Hordak,Who are you? What are you doing here?
5,11,0,Hordak,Why do I know your face?
5,11,0,Entrapta,Hordak?
5,11,0,Hordak,"No, do not say that name to me. I have no name."
5,11,0,Hordak,What have you done to me?
5,11,0,Entrapta,You do remember me. I knew you would.
5,11,0,Swift Wind,"Get away from her! Entrapta, let's go!"
5,11,0,Hordak,"Go. Maybe then these memories, these imperfections, will leave me."
5,11,0,Entrapta,Remember! Your imperfections are beautiful!
5,11,0,Bow,Whoa.
5,11,0,Glimmer,That is the Failsafe?
5,11,0,Bow,It's bigger than I thought it'd be. How are we gonna get that to the Heart?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,The Failsafe is a code. It's stored inside of the Crystal.
5,11,0,Adora,"So, what do we--?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,It needs a password.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,I think you already know what it is.
5,11,0,Adora,We're friends of Mara.
5,11,0,Glimmer,What does it say?
5,11,0,Adora,"""Someone needs to go inside and accept the Failsafe""? What does that mean?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,It means the Failsafe must be bonded to a willing soul and carried to the Heart of Etheria in their body in order to be deployed.
5,11,0,Bow,And we're sure that's safe?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,We can't turn back now. The Failsafe is within our grasp.
5,11,0,Catra,"Adora, don't go in there."
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"Catra, this is not the time. Someone must take the Failsafe."
5,11,0,Catra,"So, you do it, then. I've been watching you the whole way in. You've been in here before, haven't you? You could've taken the Failsafe yourself and gotten all the power you've ever wanted. But you didn't. Why?"
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,You're being paranoid. This is the only way to stop Prime. Adora understands that well enough.
5,11,0,Catra,Why does it have to be Adora? What is going to happen to her? What aren't you telling us?
5,11,0,Castaspella,Answer the question.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Whoever uses the Failsafe must absorb the full magic of the Heart when it is destroyed. That much raw magical power would burn any mere mortal apart. None of us are strong enough.
5,11,0,Adora,But She-Ra is.
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Only She-Ra can hope to survive the process. No one else can do it.
5,11,0,Adora,And if I don't survive it?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,Then the magic will be restored to Etheria through your sacrifice. You will give us the power to bring us victory. Prime will be defeated. Your friends will be free.
5,11,0,Castaspella,You were planning this all along!
5,11,0,Catra,Why are you surprised by this?
5,11,0,Glimmer,It's not going to work!
5,11,0,Bow,There is no way we're risking Adora like that!
5,11,0,Adora,Stop it!
5,11,0,Adora,I'll do it.
5,11,0,Catra,No. What? What's wrong with you? Shadow Weaver is sacrificing you. Why can't you see that?
5,11,0,Adora,"Because even if she is, it's better than Prime getting the Heart and destroying the universe! We're out of options. This is the only way."
5,11,0,Micah,"Well, look who it is."
5,11,0,Catra,Adora!
5,11,0,Bow,Whoa!
5,11,0,Glimmer,Dad!
5,11,0,Micah,"Hello, daughter. I'm so pleased to see you."
5,11,0,Micah,"And you, sister."
5,11,0,Micah,"Her, not so much."
5,11,0,Adora,Glimmer!
5,11,0,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull! No.
5,11,0,Bow,We have to get out of here!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,The Failsafe! We can't!
5,11,0,Catra,"Adora, no! Please. It doesn't always have to be you!"
5,11,0,Catra,Adora!
5,11,0,Micah,Ahh.
5,11,0,Glimmer,What's happening?
5,11,0,Glimmer,Is that--?
5,11,0,Micah,"Dark magic. After all, I learned from the best."
5,11,0,Castaspella,"Micah, no!"
5,11,0,Adora,For the Honor of Grayskull!
5,11,0,Adora,I've got it. I've got the Failsafe. Let's get out of here.
5,11,0,Adora,Catra.
5,11,0,Adora,Catra?
5,11,0,Adora,"Catra, stop!"
5,11,0,Adora,You were just gonna leave?
5,11,0,Catra,"I'm doing you a favor. I'm a distraction, right? Now you can go save the world without having to worry about me confusing you."
5,11,0,Adora,"No, that's not true. Don't listen to Shadow Weaver. This isn't about her."
5,11,0,Catra,Why? Why are you like this? Why do you always have to sacrifice everything for everyone else? When do you get to choose?
5,11,0,Catra,"What do you want, Adora?"
5,11,0,Adora,"I...I have to do this, Catra. I'm the only one who can."
5,11,0,Catra,Then do it. That's what you want. That's what you'll always choose. I don't have to stay and watch it happen.
5,11,0,Adora,"Catra, please, stay. I need you."
5,11,0,Catra,"No, you don't. You never have."
5,11,0,Adora,Catra!
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, you made the right choice. Don't let Catra convince you otherwise. She's never understood."
5,11,0,Adora,Stop! I will never forgive you. You ruin people. You ruin any chance they could ever be happy. Haven't you done enough?
5,11,0,Shadow Weaver,I did what I had to do.
5,11,0,Adora,"Keep telling yourself that. I'm going to take the Failsafe to the Heart, and I'm going to save Etheria. But I am not doing it for you. I'll do everything I can to make sure you never get your hands on the magic."
5,12,0,Perfuma,These flowers really bring out the color in your eyes.
5,12,0,Swift Wind,"Bow, could you stop playing that thing?"
5,12,0,Bow,"Hey, I'm still learning."
5,12,0,Glimmer,"Well, I like it."
5,12,0,Bow,Hey...
5,12,0,Adora,"Prime is getting closer every day to figuring out how to access the Heart of Etheria. If he succeeds, he can use it to destroy worlds, galaxies, maybe even the entire universe. The Failsafe is our only chance at stopping him. But Prime still has our friends. His hold over them grows stronger every day they're chipped. If we don't free them now, we might lose them forever. Prime holds every advantage in this fight. He'll be ready for us. But we have a plan. Entrapta?"
5,12,0,Entrapta,"I finally succeeded in cracking Prime's signal pattern. If I get access to his Spire network, I can use it to broadcast a jamming frequency that will disable all of the chips on Etheria, freeing everyone at once!"
5,12,0,Adora,"I need you all to get Entrapta to the Spire and keep Prime's forces distracted while she jams the signal. I'm gonna take the Failsafe to the Heart and destroy it, once and for all. We're going to make sure that Prime can never hurt anyone ever again. We're ending this today. For good."
5,12,0,Entrapta,Yeah!
5,12,0,Adora,Oh.
5,12,0,Bow,"You weren't trying to sneak out without us, were you?"
5,12,0,Glimmer,Any sign of Catra?
5,12,0,Adora,She's not coming back. Are you sure you guys should come? We don't know what to expect from the Heart of Etheria. It could be dangerous for you.
5,12,0,Bow,"There's no way we're letting you do this on your own. Whatever we find, we fix this together."
5,12,0,Adora,For the honor of Grayskull!
5,12,0,Other,Warning. Planetary facilitator Light Hope protocol offline. Manual administrator access not recommended at this time.
5,12,0,Adora,We're friends of Mara. Now show us where the Heart of Etheria is.
5,12,0,Other,"Welcome, friends of Mara."
5,12,0,Catra,Ow! What's wrong with you?!
5,12,0,Catra,"Stop it! Stop it! I told you, I'm not going back."
5,12,0,Catra,"You saw what happened! Adora chose Shadow Weaver, okay? Not me! Adora doesn't want me! Not like I want her."
5,12,0,Frosta,"Hey, bot-faces! Come and get us!"
5,12,0,Netossa,Plenty for both of us.
5,12,0,Other,"Brothers. It is I, a faithful acolyte of Horde Prime, just like you."
5,12,0,Entrapta,"Nice work, Wrong Hordak."
5,12,0,Castaspella,Oh! This is so exciting!
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,Perforation!
5,12,0,Perfuma,We have to keep their attention on us until Entrapta can finish.
5,12,0,Entrapta,Wow.
5,12,0,Entrapta,"Okay, Entrapta, you got this. You got this."
5,12,0,Glimmer,Are you scared?
5,12,0,Adora,No. I just really hope this works.
5,12,0,Bow,"It's okay, Adora. We'll be with you the whole way. When we get back, it'll be a whole new world."
5,12,0,Adora,Did you guys hear that?
5,12,0,Glimmer,What?
5,12,0,Adora,Catra?
5,12,0,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
5,12,0,Adora,"Catra, you came--"
5,12,0,Bow,Adora!
5,12,0,Bow,You're going the wrong way. The trail is back there. You okay?
5,12,0,Adora,We need to be careful. It looks like this place can still project memories. We can't let it distract us.
5,12,0,Catra,What?
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"My brothers. The time has come at last. No longer shall She-Ra stand in my way. The Heart shall be laid bare, its power mine for the taking."
5,12,0,Other,Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light. Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light. Cast out the shadows. Bring the universe to Prime's light.
5,12,0,Horde Prime,Begin the acquisition process.
5,12,0,Catra,Adora. We have to warn Adora!
5,12,0,Glimmer,Adora?
5,12,0,Bow,Adora!
5,12,0,Bow,Adora!
5,12,0,Bow,"Adora, are you okay?"
5,12,0,Glimmer,What's going on?
5,12,0,Adora,I think I know. This place is responding to my memories. I think I'm doing this.
5,12,0,Bow,"So, why here? And how do we get out?"
5,12,0,Adora,"When I broke the Sword, I thought...I thought I could make my own destiny. But I can't. It was always going to end like this."
5,12,0,Glimmer,"What do you mean, ""end""? Adora!"
5,12,0,Adora,"I'm losing her. I'm distracted and confused, and I'm scared. And I can't be any of those things if this is going to work."
5,12,0,Adora,I need to go the rest of the way by myself.
5,12,0,Bow,"Adora, no! You don't have to do this!"
5,12,0,Adora,I love you guys so much. I never could have done any of this without you. Thank you for being the best friends anyone could ask for.
5,12,0,Glimmer,Adora!
5,12,0,Catra,Adora! Adora!
5,12,0,Shadow Weaver,She's not here.
5,12,0,Catra,"What do you mean, she's not here? Where is she?"
5,12,0,Shadow Weaver,She's gone to the Heart of Etheria to free the magic and become the hero she was born to be. If you are still so selfish as to try and stop--
5,12,0,Catra,Enough! This isn't about you and your messed-up power trip anymore. Prime is doing something to the planet. He's infecting it. He's going for the Heart.
5,12,0,Other,"The last of Etheria's security protocols have been breached, Lord Prime. Planetary acquisition is at 20 percent."
5,12,0,Entrapta,Oh...Almost.
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"Welcome, little rebel. You're just in time to witness the end of your world."
5,12,0,Frosta,Why aren't they shooting?
5,12,0,Perfuma,"Oh, no."
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"Rejoice, Etheria, for your day of reckoning has come. I offered you mercy. But you have spurned my good graces. So be it."
5,12,0,Perfuma,Entrapta!
5,12,0,Entrapta,I'm sorry.
5,12,0,Horde Prime,Your resistance has been for naught. Your She-Ra has abandoned you. All that is left for your world is a terrible and eternal night.
5,12,0,Catra,Take us to Adora. Now!
5,12,0,Shadow Weaver,She's too far away by now. We'd never reach her in time.
5,12,0,Catra,No. Use your magic. I know you have more power than you're letting on.
5,12,0,Shadow Weaver,"It doesn't work that way, Catra!"
5,12,0,Catra,"You've done it before! When you abandoned me in the Fright Zone. And you've always been able to track us our whole lives. So, do something good with it and help me save Adora before it's too late!"
5,12,0,Shadow Weaver,Come here.
5,12,0,Glimmer,Adora! Adora!
5,12,0,Bow,Catra?
5,12,0,Catra,Where's Adora?
5,12,0,Glimmer,She...She left us. She's headed to the Heart on her own.
5,12,0,Catra,"Of course she's gone! That's what she does, isn't it?"
5,12,0,Bow,"Catra, what is going on?"
5,12,0,Catra,Horde Prime is onto you. He's hacking into the planet. All of this is from him.
5,12,0,Bow,He's gonna take the Heart.
5,12,0,Catra,That's not all. He's got Entrapta.
5,12,0,Bow,"If Prime has Entrapta, that means the other princesses are still chipped. We have to get back up there."
5,12,0,Glimmer,We can't just leave Adora!
5,12,0,Catra,I'll stay. I'll find her.
5,12,0,Glimmer,Catra...
5,12,0,Catra,"I can't lose her again, okay? I promised her a long time ago that I'd look out for her. It's time I made good on that."
5,12,0,Glimmer,"Take care of her, Horde scum."
5,12,0,Catra,"That's the plan, Sparkles. And good luck."
5,12,0,Bow,The four of us don't need luck. We're the Best Friend Squad.
5,12,0,Catra,"Get them there safe, okay?"
5,12,0,Bow,Go help the Princesses! I'll handle the signal.
5,12,0,Glimmer,Bow...I love you. I love you.
5,12,0,Bow,"I love you, too."
5,12,0,Bow,"Be careful, okay?"
5,12,0,Glimmer,Me? I'm always careful.
5,12,0,Adora,"I'm going to save Etheria, no matter what it takes. Your sacrifice won't be in vain. I promise."
5,12,0,Mara,"But at what cost? I never wanted to die. I sacrificed myself so you would never have to. Why are you doing this, Adora?"
5,12,0,Adora,It's better this way. My friends will be safe. They'll be happy.
5,12,0,Mara,And you? What do you want when this is all over?
5,12,0,Adora,I...It doesn't matter. I'm She-Ra. This is what I'm supposed to do.
5,12,0,Mara,"You're worth more than what you can give to other people. You deserve love, too. You're so close, Adora. Don't give up yet."
5,12,0,Adora,Mara? What's--?
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"Ah. Adora. So, this is where you've run to hide."
5,12,0,Perfuma,There's too many! We have to retreat!
5,12,0,Netossa,Retreat where? We're totally surrounded.
5,12,0,Frosta,Yeah!
5,12,0,Glimmer,Miss me?
5,12,0,Frosta,"Yes, but also, behind you!"
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,Mermista. Horde Prime thinks he controls you. But I know you. And I'm gonna prove it to you with the power of shanty! Oh--Whoa! Downward!
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,"You know, this is actually kind of nice. Doesn't it remind you of the first time we met? You also tried to kill me then."
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,Couldn't wait to sweep me off my feet?
5,12,0,Mermista,Why are you like this?
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,"Because I love you, dearest. And also, it's a good distraction."
5,12,0,Sea Hawk,Please forgive me for that when you're back to normal.
5,12,0,Frosta,"Uh, guys? Did anyone see where Scorpia went?"
5,12,0,Glimmer,"I'm gonna help Bow with the signal. Aunt Casta, can you--?"
5,12,0,Micah,"Hello, baby girl."
5,12,0,Adora,You're not here. You can't stop me.
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"How strange. I must have fought her, must have known her face. But I have no memory of it."
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"I've seen so many like her over the years. One by one, all their faces have been lost to oblivion. Just as yours will be."
5,12,0,Horde Prime,"A parting gift from the First Ones. Their old security system. Capable of taking out even one as strong as She-Ra. You will never make it to the Heart, Adora. Your own people made sure of that. Goodbye, my oldest enemy."
5,13,0,Catra,"Hey, Adora."
5,13,0,Adora,Catra! You can't be here. It's too dangerous. Shadow Weaver?
5,13,0,Catra,Get Adora to the Heart. I'll take care of this thing.
5,13,0,Adora,"Catra, no!"
5,13,0,Catra,"I'll catch up, ok? Get to the Heart."
5,13,0,Adora,"No, no. Catra!"
5,13,1,Glimmer,Dad. no!
5,13,1,Micah,"What's wrong, baby girl? I've never felt better."
5,13,2,Bow,"Scorpia, please! We're trying to save you."
5,13,3,Glimmer,"Dad, please! It's me, it's Glimmer!"
5,13,3,Micah,"Oh, I know who you are. My daughter. The weakling. The failure. And so it ends. Pathetic. Alone. Weak."
5,13,3,Glimmer,Mom. No. I'm not.
5,13,3,Glimmer,My mother raised me to be brave. My friends taught me to be kind. And I'm stubborn. I get that from you. I will never stop fighting! And I won't lose another parent!
5,13,3,Glimmer,"I love you, Dad."
5,13,4,Bow,I've got it!
5,13,4,Bow,"Scorpia, it's okay."
5,13,4,Bow,"Prime may have made you do a lot of things,but he can't turn you into something you're not. So, right now, all I need you to do is trust me."
5,13,9,Scorpia,"Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry. Did I hurt you? I did not mean to do that."
5,13,9,Bow,Welcome back.
5,13,10,Entrapta,My device worked! I knew it would.
5,13,10,Horde Prime,Deploy all clone battalions. Get this under control!
5,13,10,Bow,"Hey, everyone. I'm Bow. Prime is probably trying to get his channel back. I have to make this quick. Prime's controlled the universe for a long time. Right now,we're the only thing standing in the way of him controlling it forever. You might be feeling hopeless. You might be thinking ""We don't stand a chance."" And maybe we don't. Prime's too strong. His army is too powerful. But that's not gonna stop us. We need to show Prime we're not afraid of him, because we have each other. And we have love. We can't give up. And if we go down, we go down together. We need you. All of you. It's time to take back our world. It's time to fight. For She-Ra, for our homes, for each other!"
5,13,10,Horde Prime,Put an end to this mockery. Destroy them all!
5,13,11,Horde Prime,"Oh, little sister. What a shame. I had such high hopes for you."
5,13,12,Adora,"No. No, wait!"
5,13,12,Shadow Weaver,Don't lose your focus. We're so close.
5,13,12,Adora,Catra!
5,13,12,Shadow Weaver,"Adora, wait!"
5,13,13,Horde Prime,"So brave, risking yourself for Adora. But it will make no difference. The Heart is almost mine, and when it is, your Adora will die."
5,13,13,Horde Prime,"So, tell me,little sister, was it worth it?"
5,13,13,Catra,Shadow Weaver?
5,13,13,Shadow Weaver,Take Adora and run!
5,13,13,Catra,What are you...?
5,13,13,Shadow Weaver,"I told you to run! Now, run!"
5,13,13,Catra,"Shadow Weaver, no! What are you doing?"
5,13,13,Shadow Weaver,"Please, Catra. You need to make sure Adora reaches the Heart. The magic must be set free."
5,13,13,Catra,Stop it! It's going to kill you!
5,13,13,Shadow Weaver,"It's too late for me. But you, this is only the beginning for you. I am so proud of you, Catra."
5,13,13,Catra,No! No!
5,13,13,Adora,Catra?
5,13,13,Shadow Weaver,You're welcome.
5,13,13,Catra,Come on. We have to go.
5,13,14,Other,Yeah!
5,13,15,Horde Prime,Impossible.
5,13,15,Entrapta,You can't control us. You don't understand what makes us strong. And that's why you'll never win.
5,13,16,Adora,The Heart of Etheria. We made it.
5,13,16,Catra,What is it? What's wrong?
5,13,16,Adora,I don't... I don't know. I can't transform. It's Prime's virus. It's keeping me from becoming She-Ra.
5,13,16,Catra,What does that mean? Is the Failsafe not going to work without her?
5,13,16,Adora,No. It'll work. Get as far away from here as you can. I have to do this next part on my own.
5,13,16,Catra,"Adora, what is going to happen to you?"
5,13,16,Adora,"Without She-Ra, the magic will destroy me. I'm sorry, Catra. I'm so sorry. But there's no more time. It has to end here. I can still save everybody. It's okay. I'm ready."
5,13,16,Catra,No.
5,13,16,Adora,Catra...
5,13,16,Catra,"No. I'm not leaving. Whatever happens, I am staying with you."
5,13,16,Catra,Adora?
5,13,16,Catra,"No, no, no, no, no. No! No!"
5,13,17,Horde Prime,Ah. I can feel it. The Heart is mine!
5,13,17,Entrapta,You can't do this! The Heart's power is too unstable! It will take you and the whole universe with it!
5,13,17,Horde Prime,"I have had enough of this chatty little rebel. Dispose of her now. My dominion was perfect. Everything was as it should be. Everything was as it should be. And so it shall be again. Did you not hear me, little brother? Do it now."
5,13,17,Hordak,"I am not your brother. You made me in your image, but I am more than that. I gave myself a name, I made a life of my own. I made... a friend. I am Hordak, and, I defy your will."
5,13,17,Entrapta,You did it! I knew you could--
5,13,17,Horde Prime,"Ah, little brother. So it's true. You have been thoroughly corrupted. So be it."
5,13,17,Entrapta,No!
5,13,17,Horde Prime,"You have forced my hand. I will unleash The Heart, and so we shall die in cleansing flame together!"
5,13,18,Scorpia,Whoo!
5,13,18,Bow,Glimmer!
5,13,18,Glimmer,Bow!
5,13,18,Horde Prime,"Rejoice, Etheria, for your end has finally come! You have chosen darkness, and so, into darkness you shall be plunged. The world shall end in fire."
5,13,18,Glimmer,Adora!
5,13,18,Bow,The Failsafe. It didn't work.
5,13,18,Horde Prime,"And when the ashes scatter, at last, there will be, peace!"
5,13,19,Catra,"Adora. Adora, stay awake!"
5,13,19,Adora,I'm sorry.
5,13,19,Catra,Adora! Adora!
5,13,20,Glimmer,Just let me brush it!
5,13,20,Catra,No!
5,13,20,Catra,Don't let her touch me. She's gonna torture me.
5,13,20,Glimmer,Do you always have to be this dramatic?
5,13,20,Bow,Come on guys. If we are late to Scorpia's first ball she is going to kill us.
5,13,20,Glimmer,Fine! You're off the hook. This time.
5,13,20,Catra,You coming?
5,13,20,Horde Prime,A beautiful wish. But there will be no future. Not for you.
5,13,20,Catra,Adora! Please! You have to wake up!
5,13,20,Catra,You can't give up. You have never given up on anything in your life. Not even on me.
5,13,20,Catra,So don't you dare start now!
5,13,20,Adora,It's too late. I've failed.
5,13,20,Catra,No! No!
5,13,20,Catra,I've got you. I'm not letting go.
5,13,20,Catra,"Don't you get it? I love you. I always have. So please, just this once. Stay!"
5,13,20,Catra,Stay.
5,13,20,Adora,You... love me?
5,13,20,Catra,You're such an idiot.
5,13,20,Adora,I love you too.
5,13,21,Horde Prime,"Cry, Etheria! Cry for Prime's mercy! There will be no comfort for you! All the universe will be consumed in undying flame!"
5,13,21,Horde Prime,"Though all is reduced to rubble, Prime shall rise again. So it has been, and so it always shall be."
5,13,21,Adora,No. You're wrong. It's time for you to go.
5,13,21,Hordak,I remember you.
5,13,21,Entrapta,"Hordak! I'm so glad you're back! Oh, we have so much to talk about!"
5,13,21,Micah,Glimmer?
5,13,21,Glimmer,"Hi, Dad."
5,13,21,Micah,I... You... Hello. I'm your dad!
5,13,21,Glimmer,Dad.
5,13,21,Scorpia,Perfuma! Hi. Wow you look... you look great.
5,13,21,Catra,"Hey, Scorpia. Look, I... Ooh, there it is!"
5,13,21,Scorpia,You know I'm a hugger.
5,13,21,Perfuma,Princess hug!
5,13,21,Entrapta,I'm so glad you're here! Oh...
5,13,21,Mermista,"So are we all just, like, okay with this?"
5,13,21,Bow,Look at us now. From capturing you to us now being buddies.
5,13,21,Catra,We did it!
5,13,21,Bow,This is so dope!
5,13,21,Razz,"Ah. You'd be proud, Mara dearie."
5,13,21,Catra,Adora?
5,13,21,Adora,It's over. He's gone.
5,13,21,Catra,Good riddance.
5,13,21,Bow,"So, what are we going to do now?"
5,13,21,Adora,We can bring magic back to the universe. What do you guys say to one more Best Friends Squad road trip?
5,13,21,Glimmer,I'm in!
5,13,21,Bow,Obviously!
5,13,21,Catra,"Of course I'm going with you, dummy."
5,13,21,Adora,Then let's do this. Together.
